  Hi Aziz,


  Great video! One minor thing, and I really feel dumb asking this...but where
  the heck is the "separator" character on the keyboard that you used before the
  client name? Will a backslash work instead? I don't see anything that looks
  like what you used.... a straight up and down line.
