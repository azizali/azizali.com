  Hey Aziz,


  Man this is great content here buddy. If it works as you say, I sure won't
  mind getting inquiries from the professionals at LinkedIn who are interested
  in my services.


  I started applying what you said here, but for some reason, I cannot add more
  than one "past position"? It's like I tried to edit and add another past
  position, with my keywords, but it won't let me. Any reason why? Did you
  encounter this too?
