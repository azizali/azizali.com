  Great video Aziz. Thanks for the excellent tip. 


  How do I see what keywords I am currently being found under? Also my business
  doesn't really have an applicable "industry" on LI. I run business networking
  events and I have to have myself list under information technology and
  services as there is nothing else closer. 


  I think I should be under keywords business development, business marketing,
  business networking, etc but none are there?


  Any ideas?


  Cheers, ilana
