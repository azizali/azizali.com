  Hi Aziz, great video. I am a therapist and treat people with various medical
  conditions. How would you get around the issue of people not wanting their
  names released and patient privacy?

  Even if they are willing to let me put up their names would you think that
  this looks bad because people who might find me would think that I am not
  concerned about their privacy - What image does it give to others? 

  What do you think? Any ideas how to get around this problem?

  all the best

  Daniel
