  Although I originally was blown away by this method and even sent the author
  Aziz an email extending this appreciation. However....


  The problem with this method is that it really only affects how YOU view the
  result pages. If you were to login using another persons account...unrelated
  whatsoever to your industry...you would see that this method is not as
  effective as you once thought. For example when I search for some of the
  target words Aziz is after...he does not appear on the first page even. 


  I'm sure that, as he mentioned in the video, that the system works better if
  you apply it to 20+ past experiences. So I might be out to lunch on that one
  as I have not reached the 20 mark yet but I will be sure to report back if I
  am indeed wrong.


  Pura vida!
