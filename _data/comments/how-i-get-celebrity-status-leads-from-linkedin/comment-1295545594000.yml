  Since you are therapist, lets agree that there are several psychological
  factors that motivate humans towards action. One of the factors you could use
  is letting them believe that by sharing their results they are doing good to
  the world since world is going to be more aware about the problem and their
  treatment will help save a lot of people.


  My belief is that most people are good in their core, and they want to do good
  in the world. If you appeal to their core that by publishing their name, they
  will help spread awareness, you will get a lot of people agree to publish
  their info.


  Answer to your second question!

  99% of the people do not think-> "Oh my God! that Doctor is publishing patient
  info!!!"  They don't think like that.

  You can always include a disclaimer in your publishing saying-> "Patient
  agreed to share info for public awareness"


  Hope that helps
