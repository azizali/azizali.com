  Don, the LinkedIn search algorithm takes into consideration the connection
  level as well.


  So, If a searcher is a first degree connection in your network, you will be
  higher in his results as opposed to a person who is not in the searchers
  network.


  I don't see this as a problem but as a challenge. To overcome this challenge,
  we must build a bigger network so we can influence the maximum amount of
  searchers.
