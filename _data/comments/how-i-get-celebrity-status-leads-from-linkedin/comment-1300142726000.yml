  Aziz,


  Love the content and the video is great value. In fact we've tested it and it
  works exactly as you show in the video. I have two issues though. I've found
  people that use the search in LinkedIn to be more technically savvy. Because
  of this when I search for the keywords you mention and visit both your
  profiles they look very obviously targeted. Hence the mass amount of "SEO" in
  one of you job positions. Have you found this detracts people or is it really
  a numbers game?


  Next as with all minor holes in search, social, etc. as more people learn
  about functions such as this it has a declining opportunity value. First, more
  people put this into practice, second the network (LinkedIn) in this case
  tends to reign it in. Or in a drastic case remove or suspend accounts. So I
  guess I ask how long have you been doing this? 


  LinkedIn is the last network I spend proactive effort within (except for some
  great PPC ads we've found that convert). Although it probably should be the
  top network... which is what brought me to your site.


  I'm not knocking you, in fact I'm glad I found your video today and will
  continue to follow your stuff. More on continue the conversation from someone
  who likes to find similar opportunities in systems.
