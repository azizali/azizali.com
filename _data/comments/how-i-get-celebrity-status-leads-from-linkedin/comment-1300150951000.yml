  Great points you brought up Scott!

  A1. There is a lot of "Numbers Game" in it as of now.

  LinkedIn's search algorithm is way too simple and naive.

  A2. I have been doing this for more than 6 months now.

  I agree with you on what you are saying about LinkedIn PPC.

  I checked out your website, and I like what you have.

  Talk soon.
