  Tab, That is an interesting case.


  I believe that you have done everything right. Possibly these two factors are
  preventing your wife's profile from showing up in search.

  1. She doesn't have a customized Public Profile URL.. Make a short Public
  Profile URL for her linkedIn profile

  2. Check her settings for profile visibility:
  http://www.linkedin.com/profile/public-profile-settings


  Hope that helps
