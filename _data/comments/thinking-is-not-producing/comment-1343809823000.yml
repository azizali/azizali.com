message: "That's why we should write down daily goals, even if very little like making a phone call, and write it off as done ( if we actually did it!).\r\nSmall daily steps helps achieve our goals.\r\nThe bigger the step we can do the better...now I'll go and try to apply this principle to my business :)\r\nThanks Aziz!"
