  Its true...6 hrs sleep keeps you more active followed by 20 mins nap in the
  afternoon...i think this is the best... I have tried this in my childhood
  days...but recently i developed the habit of sleeping long hours ...whenever i
  sleep long hours i am still very weak and yawning all the time...
