  Every body is different. No matter what the "experts" say. I feel that the
  days I work out, or do physically demanding activity, I neeeeed to sleep more
  and its extreeeemly difficult to wake up early. So honor your body, don't try
  to make it into its not.


  So if you have worked out a lot, and your body needs to recover, let it sleep
  more.
