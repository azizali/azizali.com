  Lunch time is fine. Many jobs are flexible. I used to go to my car and sleep
  at one point. 

  In another job I used to come home and sleep for 20 minutes. My home was 10
  mins away. Yes my lunch break would be longer that way.


  Now adays I do not do it. See what fits in your lifestyle and use it
