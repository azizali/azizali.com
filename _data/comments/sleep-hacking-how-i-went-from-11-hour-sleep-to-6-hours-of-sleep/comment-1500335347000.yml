  I have work third shift and my goal is to fall asleep when I get home and
  sleep 6 hours and then workout and still have some time in the evenings to
  hang with my kids. What happens is I don't sleep for a few hours and skip the
  workout and also get very little time with my kids cause my body tries to
  sleep all evening. I have always thought I am just screwed cause I work at
  night but after reading this I have some hope!
