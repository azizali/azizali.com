  This is great. So where does body rhythm fit into this? I am down for trying
  the 6 hour thing because my sleep patterns are clearly not working. But what
  if you are the most alert and awake at night? I have never been a morning
  person, not even when I was a child. Does it matter when I get the 6 hours of
  sleep? Also, I am a freelancer and work at home. so a big part of the problem
  is that there is no separation between home/work/rest but maybe that's a whole
  other issue.
