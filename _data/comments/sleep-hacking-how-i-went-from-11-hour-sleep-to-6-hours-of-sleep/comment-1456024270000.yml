message: "Thanks Aziz, I actually giggled when you said that you beat yourself up for sleeping that long ..cos that's what I do! I get pissed off with myself cos I a, trying to fix my sleeping pattern. And also about its dark out there, I cam keep sleeping. What's worse is that my room is completely dark cos I have shutters, so I don't know if it's daylight yet. But I read make it dark to sleep ..grrr...going in circles.\r\nCould you make your list of conclusion a bit more detailed eg. You didn't add 20 min nap.. I wanted a print out version to stick on my fridge."
