message: "I like this sleep routine/regimen.  However, I'm not sold on exercising in the morning is any better than exercising in the evening.  What I've found through experience is a good (rigorous) workout during the morning leads to me feeling tired a couple of hours after the workout because of endorphin crash.\r\n\r\nSo, I get what you're saying about exercise (it is very important) in the morning.  However, it doesn't have to be an intense workout (just enough to get the blood flowing).  A more rigorous workout in the evening followed by food helps to mellow me out for bed time.  That's what works for me."
