  It's tough and almost impractical. If you change your lifestyle on the
  weekend, you cannot judge yourself to wake up early and be upset with yourself
  if you don't.


  Personally I want my routines to be the same. But the ways I sleep late, I
  expect to wake up late too. And I am okay with that.


  Tip: Don't put impractical expectations on yourself.
