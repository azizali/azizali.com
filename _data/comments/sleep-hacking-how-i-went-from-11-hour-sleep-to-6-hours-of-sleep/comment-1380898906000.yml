  When I say 20 minutes nap, for me 20 minutes from the time I lay down to the
  time I wake up. That may be too short for some people. I have noticed 30-40
  minutes nap would be more appropriate for others.


  Now about your point of taking longer to fall asleep, that is common at night
  times. But mid day napping may come faster because most people feel tired
  mid-day. Napping mid-day is a very very very old practice in human history.
  Actually my mom and grandmother religiously used to nap for an hour 7 years
  ago. And they occasionally do that today.
