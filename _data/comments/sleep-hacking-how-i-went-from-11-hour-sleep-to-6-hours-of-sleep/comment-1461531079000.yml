message: "I am so interested in trying this as I have had times in my life (in my 20's) where I exercised in the morning and never needed coffee. I had moments though of when I thought I had narcolepsy though. That's where I could have used that little nap! I would pull off the road and nap 15 minutes and then I was fine. \r\nNow(in my 40s) I am coffee all day and monsters and fall alseep only with wine and its ridiculous. I'm tired, exhausted, agrivated.  I need a new plan."
