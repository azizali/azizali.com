  I train for a total of up to 3-4 hours per day 4-6 days per week. I tweak the
  hours/days depending on how hard I pushed. When I get rest I can usualy only
  get 7 hours due to my boy being tired and can't get a good quality sleep
  without needing to rehydrate/eat. Then if i rest a few more days I can sleep
  for 10 hours at a a time. Is this bad? no my body needs it. However, it's easy
  to fall into the trap... if i keep resting it will go to 12 hours etc with
  naps. The key is to get back to training when fully recovered. So MOVE. more
  than an hour per day. Then sleep is used bet
