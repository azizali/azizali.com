  Found this through google. When you say a 20 minute nap do you count from when
  you fall asleep? Or do you just lay down for 20 mins. When i try to nap it
  usually takes 30 mins at least, sometimes even an hour, just to fall asleep.
  Makes it hard to keep it to 20 mins of sleep when i dont know when sleep will
  start.
