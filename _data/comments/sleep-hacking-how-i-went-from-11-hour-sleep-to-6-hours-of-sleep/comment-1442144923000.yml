message: "Thanks Aziz for your nice article.\r\nI would like to ask you that how did you manage this new habit during weekends? Most o the times it is the case that I have something do to in weekend nights (hanging out with friends, having some guests, watching movies) and it gets s difficult in the day after to maintain the habit. Is it so serious to keep this habit even during the weekends? Any suggestion for that?"
