  Glad to found this post.  I just graduate from high school and I have 3-4 free
  months until I go to university. And during this free month I always sleep at
  12 and wake up at 10, then after one month I sleep at 1 and wake up at 11
  sometimes 12. On June I sleep at 2am and wake up at 1pm! I start thinking this
  is not right. And now I sleep at 3am and always wake up on 1pm. I can't fall
  asleep easily. And from now on I'll try this "sleep hacking". Thanks!
