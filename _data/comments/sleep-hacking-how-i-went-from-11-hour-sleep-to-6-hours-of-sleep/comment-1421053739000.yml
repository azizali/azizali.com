  Everything you mentioned I already suffer from. Especially the one where you
  only wake up early when you have a commitment. It's so frustrating to know
  that I can wake up whatever time during the morning if i have school or plans
  with my friends, but can't on days when I'm free.  I want to change my
  sleeping pattern so bad. Glad I found a post on this. I'll follow your steps
  and hopefully sleep less.
