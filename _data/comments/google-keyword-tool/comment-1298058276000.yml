  Aziz, I love your videos but I have a few questions. I am a producer and I
  have beats online for music artists to buy. I would like to gain more
  traffic/customers. I have never used adwords, ppc, or any of these tools but I
  want to start. I just want to make sure I take the right approach so I can
  nail my target market and boost my sales right away. I noticed in this video
  you mentioned how most people dont know what they are doing and thats why they
  pay the amounts shown. Well, I think it's safe to say I would be one of those
  people if I started doing this righ now. So please tell me what is the first
  thing i need to do and then the following steps i need to take to be succesful
  in the online market of selling beats. Thank you so much for reading this.
  Keep the videos comin man! :)
