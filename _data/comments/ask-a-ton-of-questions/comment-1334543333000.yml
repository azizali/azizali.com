  You are absolutely right on Remco!


  But there is another spin to it.


  If one asks the question "What if I fail?" It is good to ask that question
  since now you will know what you have to loose. Worst case, if that idea
  doesn't work, I will end up in my parents house.


  Or 


  Is the worst case: I am going to be sued for implementing that idea?


  As you said, as long as questions are asked in the light of becoming more
  progressive and clear, more questions the better.
