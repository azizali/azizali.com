message: "I agree that questions can keep you focussed. On the other hand there is a danger that if you ask yourself the wrong questions you'll go in the negative direction. I am talking about questions like \"what if I fail?\", \"what do I do if people think I am a clown?\"\r\nbut obviously you mean the empowering questions!\r\n\r\n;-)"
