  Yes Thomas Edison was a man that set out to do something that has never been
  done before.  That takes unwavering commitment and determination.  Most people
  let little obstacle stand in the way of them accomplishing things. If only
  they remembered that 9 times out of 10 someone has already done what they are
  thinking about doing.  So that means it is not impossible.
