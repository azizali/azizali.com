  Great insights Aziz.  Do you think there are different entertainment "types" 
  depending on your audience?  For example, should a person try a different type
  of humor if appealing to a professional audience as opposed to young
  consumers?  Or, is there a common denominator of entertainment that will work
  across segments?


  I'm struggling with coming up with the proper tone for a series of videos
  aimed at the analytical professional person.


  Thanks for your videos.  Good stuff!
