message: "Hi Fred,\n\nThanks for the comments. Firstly, I want to re-mention that I do not support or dis-support AppGratis, I have never used them, an I do not know much details. My blog post was strictly a response to the claims posted on Jeremy's blog.\n\nSo to all the bullets you have mentioned\n<ol>\n\t<li>Promotion is not bad(Paid to free, or Free who cares), making false claims is bad</li>\n\t<li>Grey hat to Black hat</li>\n\t<li>That is false claiming if someone does that</li>\n\t<li>Yup, Ads should always be disclosed, that is against the law actually to not disclose that ads are ads</li>\n\t<li>I don't think there is anything wrong with putting a registration wall, or share to download wall. Its noting unethical. Its not completely cool, but this is not unethical.</li>\n\t<li>Yeah, this sounds a little uncool</li>\n\t<li>There is nothing wrong with claiming exclusivity</li>\n\t<li>Again, lack of disclosure where necessary and false claims are bad</li>\n</ol>\n\nIf people are abandoning them, good right. Its a democratic ecosystem. People will love them or hate them as they please. And that's what I like about democracy :)"
