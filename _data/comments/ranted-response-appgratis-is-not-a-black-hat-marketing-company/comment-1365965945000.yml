message: "Ali i have been observing this company for some time, not just as a user but as someone who works in the ad industry. Here is my question to you.\r\n\r\nHow do you call a company with such practices?\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>- Build their brand on \"paid to free app daily\" and every week promotes apps that are totally free. Not a promotion. </li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>- Claim organizing deals that do not exist: ask the develop to artificially raise the price of an app a few days before they got magically promoted to free</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>- Claim a price reduction on apps that are already Free, when they are already free: like yesterday with the card game</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>- Hardly disclose advertising to their users (it is so tiny, and so invisible). No normal user can ever know those are ads or paid for promotion</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>- Prompts a sharing option to every user before they get to download an app</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>- Forces developers to change the description of their app to promote themself first</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>- Prohibit developers to work with any other ad network prior to their promotion</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>- Promote promotions negotiated by others but do not disclose the fact it was organized by others (taking the credit for it) - eg the deals of the app store or other paid to free services</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs that \"clean\"  - white hat marketing?\r\n\r\nThe comparison with Digg is irrelevant: Digg was non paid, and moderated by a community. Not an ad agency/and an algorithm. The comparison with StumbleUpon is irrelevant: their service is not paid placement and when it is in the flow of recommendations it is clearly disclosed and represents a tiny fraction of the content browsed\r\n\r\nFinally you say \"12 million users\" but a big majority of do not seem to use the service anymore. Or do they? what is the real %? 20% / 30% at best? it means the huge majority of their users has decided to totally abandon them..."
