  My question - I don't know who else to ask.  I see you are very knowledgeable.

  My very good youtube helpful videos have been uploaded to many websites. I am
  an affiliate for a product and offer some review and some education but I hope
  to get the affiliate sale.


  These other websites insert a clickable link at the end of my video essay
  description to someone else. I also see that these websites put clickable
  links into my essay that connect to their advertisers.

   Is this beneficial for me to have allow my youtube videos out there. (Since they may be posted on a higher ranking site than my own website) Your comments are appreciated.
  Thank you for your help.
