  I am a little confused with your question, but I will try my best to answer
  it.


  When you say your youtube video is on other websites, does that mean people
  are embeding your video on their websites?

  If so, I would encourage that since you will get more and more views on your
  video. Youtube will know that your video is getting embedded a lot therefore
  it will assume it has valuable content and again you will get additional
  traffic from youtube.


  If you are referring to your video being distributed on other video sharing
  websites, this is also good since you can get backlinks from those description
  sections to your website.


  If people are leveraging your video and selling their own stuff, you can
  always put WATERMARKS/ANNOTATIONS on your video and brand your video to your
  website so the viewers will establish a bond with your website/brand than with
  the stuff these other website owners are selling.


  Hope this answers it.


  If not, email me and I'll help ya.
