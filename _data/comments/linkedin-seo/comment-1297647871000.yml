  Hey Shriks,

  You asked me a very broad and debatable question.

  The answer to your question varies by the MARKET your are in.


  If you are in the food business and launching a product, you can give away
  free food sample for taste test and attracting customers.

  If you are in the gadgets business you can't do that.


  In come markets branding works great, in others, infomercials type marketing
  works best.
