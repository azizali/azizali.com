  Good advice, best understood by all who will be successful to remember:


  if you focus on failure that's what you see

  if you want to see something decay watch a dead body

  if you want to see the natural prosperity of life work like you mean to see -
  what you do (the object others see, or what you sell) is the expression of the
  heart of your desire for life


  how's that for philosphic  =)
