  In agreement, I am.  I believe if we took some time to really study some basic
  psychology on how people think, we would have a better understanding.  The
  most puzzling question for entrepreneurs is "how to   create/corner the market
  share for your goods and services."  It seems that we need to answer that
  basic question "how do we..." 


  So understanding human emotions, their desires are crucial.  Then the other
  thing, understanding all these methods to reach your niche or target market
  using current/modern technologies and applications.


  It shouldn't be so complicated, yet we spend countless hours research,
  searching, tweaking, changing, perfecting....oh goodness! It gets
  overwhelming.

  We just have to keep on seeking, questioning and connecting with each other. 
  Creating meaning relationships that last.


  Anyway, great blog, I love this layout, nice and clean.
