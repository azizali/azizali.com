  hey Aziz, 


  listen, i'm a great fan of you and your input, I always read what you have to
  say, and must admit you nailed it right on the head there. I'm working since 1
  year for myself, and it's true that if you want to be successful in what you
  do, you gotta put in extra miles, and not just a few, be willing to sit down
  and put in work and when the going gets tough, the tough should get you going!
  There are no second places, the winner takes it all! After 1 year of
  blistering hard work and networking, i'm finally starting to break through to
  some people and finally i'm getting the juicy requests, now only need to bag
  these opportunities. You see, most people think that rich people cheat and
  lie. but in fact these people made quick fortune and are falling away left and
  right because they made mistakes and their lies and cheats turned back in
  their face. the rich people that are still rich, made their fortunes by
  staying honest, helping out friends and get paid for it! Do a good job,
  customer returns, do a bad job, customer stays away. If you consider each job
  as your last job, you will always do a good job! keeps customers coming back
  for more, more importantly, stay honest. It's the only characteristic that
  should not be for sale: your Integrity. 


  keep it coming homey! saw your last offer and i'm still considering it!
