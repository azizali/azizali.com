  Aziz, You are 100% correct. That is the number 1 problem that everyone has.
  "FEAR" Fear of losing fear of destruction fear of disappointment.  That is the
  reason why people fail.  I've lived my entire life in fear and I do understand
  now.  36years of negative mindset.  Not easy to change but if it needs to
  change it has to start today.
