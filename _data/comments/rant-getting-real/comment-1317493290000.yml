  Aziz,


  Great email.  I enjoyed your linked-in seo video also.


  But...your infusionsoft account is dead/disabled.  WHen I fill in any of the
  email submits, I get sent to a 'blahblahblah account is disabled' message.


  Just thought you'd like to know.  I would like access to the info you're
  giving away (especially from the domain main page, not the blog) but neither I
  nor anyone else can tell you that right now.
