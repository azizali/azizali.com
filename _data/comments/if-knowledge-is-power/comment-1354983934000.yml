  Shad,


  I hope that this email finds you. 


  Firstly thank you very much for emailing me. I admire your willingness to take
  a stand and ask me questions and represent the idea that you believe in. With
  that I will attempt to answer/address every point you have made.


  To set the stage I would like to say that Religion and Polictics are the
  biggest levers of our society that can be used to make lives better. Religion
  gives core principals to live and politics has the power to establish the
  infrastructure to ensure order and justice. I belive all religions on its core
  teach the same thing. That is equality for all, justice and peace. I have the
  highest respect for Jesus Christ, Moses, Buddha and other religious leaders.


  Unfortunately 95% of the politicians in the world use the political lever to
  fulfill their personal desires, not to make the society better. That does not
  make politics a bad thing.


  Unfortunately, 95% of the world DO NOT follow their own religion and the
  extremest of course misinterpret the teachings and are hence misrepresenting
  their religion.


  My friend Shad,


  If Some Israely leaders are terrorising the Palestinian, it would be insane to
  blame Jewism.

  If Burma is killing Muslims it would be insane to blame the Bhuddist

  If Some Indians are killing Muslims, it would be insane to blame India as a
  nation or Hinduism as a religion

  Similarly if a hundred so called Muslims planned to attack Malala, that
  doesn't make the 3 Billion Muslims or Islam bad because the completely condemn
  their actions


  It is the conservative misinterpretation of some so called Muslims and
  Christians that technology is evil. The correct interpretation is that
  technology can be misused so we have to be careful. Technology can spread
  knowledge. I love the internet. Technology can also make bombs and kill
  people, which is bad.


  An educated person like you and I blames One mans actions on the teaching of a
  pure man who intended good, that you and I are the ones to blame for
  misinterpretation.


  <em>Dear Shad, you said "If you think he was knowledgable, why he ordered to
  kill all dogs in Medina? "Dogs are impure, so kill'em, especially the black
  ones..its the devil...</em>"


  I called a few friends to validate that story but I could not find a single
  source to validate that story.


  Yes, I agree that dogs are discouraged to be kept as pets, but there is no
  where I have heard to kill them. I am extremely glad you brought that point up
  and I am able to clarify it.


  My lovely friend Shad, I am writing this from my heart and I am soooooo happy
  that you emailed.

  To the point you said <em><strong>Because of similar "passed-on-knowledge"
  girls/women still cannot go to school or college and educate themselves, even
  got shot for trying to study. Remember Malala and another girl that was shot
  dead 2 weeks ago?</strong></em>


  I would like to quote Prophet Mohammad who said: The <em><strong>Acquisition
  of Knowledge is mandatory on every Muslim Man and Women</strong></em>

  He actively preached the rights of women, and how they should be respected,
  and nurthured. It is sad that some people do not follow his teachings. Shad,
  that means that if some people do bad, does not mean that those bad actions
  are the right religiously taught actions.


  Culturally the Indian subcontinent has a history of keeping women in the house
  for house work. Elders discourage girls from going to school, this idea has
  changed as the years have passed. It would be totally inaccurate to say that
  Islam or Hinduism preaches to not let women learn. Cultural values and
  religion some times do mesh up and are seen and practiced as one, but people
  like you and I, need to work very very hard and understanding the true
  history, and be liberated by what one does and what one says. 


  If an American Christian does and open fire in the theature on the launch of
  Batman movie (True story), it would be foolish to blame American teachings or
  to blame Christian teachings.


  Shad, I hope I have addressed your points. I know digesting them will be tough
  and it might be the case that you disagree with me. But if anything I would
  invite you to blame the person for his/her actions, not the culture, religion,
  color, race, and nationality of that person.


  This was a tough email for me to right, but I hope we can be friends have more
  intellectual conversations while respecting each other's beliefs.
