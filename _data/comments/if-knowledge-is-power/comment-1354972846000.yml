message: "Sighh... such a turn off. \r\nI've just came across your great videos on youtube and then I saw this statement as first on your blog and now I wonder why you put connection between religion and technology? (computers were announced as the work of the devil both in Islam and Christianity- so we are both in sin using a computers). \r\n\r\nProphet Mohammad is definitely among the most powerful people, thats true. But there are people killing other people because of him and the knowledge he passed. \r\n\r\nLet me ask you this:\r\nIf you think he was knowledgable, why he ordered to kill all dogs in Medina? \"Dogs are impure, so kill'em, especially the black ones..its the devil...\" \r\nGod created all beings, so why a prophet disregard/disrespect that? \r\nAnd what kind of \"knowledge\" he is passing on to his followers with such action? Do you know to what extend this event is reflecting now after 1400 years?\r\nI am living in a muslim country and I can tell you that majority of my friends despise dogs and never had a dog. I always wondered why and naively thought it is just a personal thing... until I found out - Prophet Mohammad. \r\nI was shocked...why? Because of similar \"passed-on-knowledge\" girls/women still cannot go to school or college and educate themselves, even got shot for trying to study. Remember Malala and another girl that was shot dead 2 weeks ago? \r\nSo, pretty powerful person as agreed, still influencing people after a millennia.\r\nDont get trapped in the religion's web, science will get us further and faster.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story is: pls stick to your technology tips where you are amazing! Don't be lured into religion or politics (both are dirty and bloody) you will turn off the feature customers who dont share your opinion/religion/party etc. \r\n\r\nShad Kr."
