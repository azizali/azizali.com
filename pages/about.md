My name is Aziz Ali, and this blog is about my obsession to the Top 1%. ‚ÄúHow some people achieve the top 1% of any field‚Äù -That‚Äôs what I am obsessed with. I am an entrepreneur, learn-aholic, and improvaholic and I currently run Qitch.com.

This Blog will discuss marketing, business systems, programming, design, and commonalities of mega successful entities to uncover the secrets behind such outstanding successes in history.

The _uncomfortable_ TRUTH that lies behind every success story
--------------------------------------------------------------

It was the first week of May 2006, I was 17 and a half years old, when my family and I came to Chicago, USA to fulfill my dad‚Äôs dream of higher education for me and my siblings.  
My dad had sold all of our assets and burned the ships so we could figure out a way to survive in this totally new environment.

Within a month, I was working two minimum-wage jobs, working at Dunkin Donuts and Sears as a cashier and sales person respectively. DD was 2.5 miles, and Sears was 7.5 miles away from my apartment and I¬†used to¬†walk this distance to and from work. If the weather allowed, I would ride my bicycle to work.¬† I would often find myself in sweat by the time I would reach my workplace after a long walk/biking.¬† I¬†often¬†felt embarrassed to walk in, especially at times when I would be sweating so much¬†that the color of my skin was visible¬†through the white uniform shirt that we were supposed to wear.

Besides my financial inability to buy a car, I was also unable to drive one at that time. I was not qualified to give a driver‚Äôs license test due to my age. (If you haven‚Äôt attended high school in USA, you must be 18+ to be eligible to give a drivers-license test‚Ä¶ I was 1/2 a year younger)

I worked like this for a few months until fall 2006 when the school semester started. I joined a community college and took full-time courses on top of my two jobs.  
In a few months I quit my ‚Äú7.5 miles away‚Äù job and replaced it with 2 {two} new ones that were either commutable by train, or were only a couple of miles away. Now I was working three jobs and¬†also had¬†full time school.

When I think about it in retrospect, it seems to me humanly impossible to attend full-time school maintaining a GPA of 3.5-3.75, and work three jobs all in which my bosses loved me because of my performance.

In one of my jobs, I earned 2 {two} awards in my first year for BEST SALES VOLUME and MOST SERVICE PLANS SOLD.  
(I have not yet celebrated my anniversary in USA and I am recognized for being the Best Sales-person in a country whose culture and slang-language I quite do not understand).  
At the same time, in my other new job, my boss¬†was so impressed by my efficiency and speed, that I later went on to get a 40% raise twice in the course of my employment.

Being a workaholic and being recognized for it was great, but I truly did not have any social life. I did not have any friends, and I had no one to show me where the cool fun places were around¬†in¬†town. I would freak out when I would go downtown, and I still do not understand how people figure out where the ‚ÄúNORTH‚Äù is when you are lost while driving.

Fast Forward
------------

I stumbled-upon making money online, and tried a lot of things and failed. I read a few books on success & mindset, and it opened my mind towards the idea that a human-being has the ability to shape its own destiny. Man! that kind of thinking really got me pumped.

As a young teenager, when somebody would say they couldn‚Äôt do something, I would reply to them ‚ÄúThe reason why you can‚Äôt do it is simply because you just said you can‚Äôt‚Äù and many of my relatives would call me a Professor because of my strange perspectives.

BTW Henry Ford copied my idea and came up with the phrase ‚ÄúWhether _you think_ that _you can_, or that _you can_‚Äòt, either way, _you_ are usually right.‚Äù

Out of frustration, and lack of confidence in myself I bought a $5000.00 coaching program offered by a well known author and put it on my credit card. The program turned out to be an absolute junk. The author talked about ‚ÄúGoing the extra mile‚Äù, and ‚Äúdoing good in the world‚Äù in his book, and his coaching program did exactly the opposite.

That put me in my first major credit card dept.

I continued to spend money, and did loads of experiments to build a digital business until I was in a dept of over $10,000.

The sun always shines after a dark night
----------------------------------------

With a lot of trial and error, I figured out ways and developed methodologies that consistently worked for me.

I figured out the importance of establishing systems, and compelling messages that really did serve the greater good of our world. I found that the biggest asset an Entrepreneur has is, his/her **congruence**, **honesty** and **belief** in his message. I think, that was the reason why I was able to sell the most volume in my sales-job with no marketing, selling, business or customer service training.

No amount of marketing, sales, leadership, and business skills is going to help you if your soul is not aligned with the truth.  
I have come to BELIEVE that we humans are freakishly smart at sensing the non verbal cues.

We can sense if a person is not Congruent with his message even before he opens his mouth. That‚Äôs how powerful our senses are.

With that, I‚Äôd like to invite you to read, comment, and like my blog posts. I am very accessible as well via email > aziz \[~at~\] qitch.com

I‚Äôd also encourage you to like my facebook page and write on my wall with any comments, suggestions, questions you may have for me.

The way you demonstrate, it is implied that you are not fumbling around and have good confidence on your presentations. The pain you had to undergo to come to this stage is worth appreciating and eye opener for us. Gold when goes into the fire comes out as pure gold. Not ash. This is the begining of your gesture. It is definite that in the future we will see you coming up as a big figure and a great example to be proud of and to follow.

Aziz:

I couldn‚Äôt agree more about the the three terms that you have developed (congruence, honesty and belief) and absolutely loved that you shared your entire story. Thank you for doing so.

Your story reminded me of one of my business partners (also of Indian descent). He \[Saurabh\] borrowed $5k from his parents (which they barely had) and got started in international consumer electronics trade only to be ripped off without any kind of warning.

He was devastated, depressed and moped around for month. His parents scolded him and constantly told him to never make the same horrible mistake and to go the conventional route. Know what he did? He waited for the dust to settle and decided to chalk the huge loss up as a learning experience and kept going after what he wanted.

Today, he has bought his family a beautiful home, travels the world at his leisure and only has to work a few hours a day (if he wants to).

Hearing your story, I feel confident that you are well on your way to creating the future that you want for you and your family. Keep working hard, Aziz, and thank you for all that you do.

Stay Awesome,

Brooks Briz

Aziz,

This is very encouraging message, thanks a lot for sharing it.  
I read this weekend the story of an IT Company which started 10 years ago in India and has now 10,000 staff. The company is mindtree, you can find their story.

The most interesting thing is that they had crisis and setbacks but were united and survived to grow.

They found out that values are very important, so no matter what our cultures if we have common values then these if practiced by all will be the glue to overcome doubt and difficulties.

Their values are

CLASS, this stands for

‚ÄùWhat brings MindTree Minds (what we call our employees) together in building an organization that has a unique culture is our value system. Every MindTree Mind is driven by CLASS, the acronym for our core values of Caring, Learning, Achieving, Sharing, and Social Responsibility. Everything we are, everything we do, and everything we believe in revolves around our CLASS values and the distinct culture that we have built. The two main attributes that characterize our culture, as our Chairman and Managing Director Ashok Soota says are high achievement orientation and high caring.‚Äù

I hope this adds value to all .

Hi Aziz,

1 year ago I left my home country I had lived for 38 years and were I had 10 years nice and succesful job as business manager.  
I started to build up my new life in France. Decided to start as enterpreneur as my boyfriend always has been. Started with more simple (seemed on fist glance) things, to be agent for interesting lifestyle products which were missing in my previous homeregion. Also, I wanted to start with no loans and as low risk as possible. As I‚Äôm an agent it also means my success is dependant on other peoples. And Oh my God! ‚Ä¶how f‚Ä¶ different and difficult it is!!!  
As you wrote, it‚Äôs a lot hard work‚Ä¶ frustration‚Ä¶fear‚Ä¶ hope‚Ä¶and temptetion to stop.  
Because of my suppliers unability to deliver propriet service, unexperience to work with agents and support their agents with business-minded service I have lost 6 months and I haven‚Äôt got the any orders fulfilled even I got clients immediately. My bank account is in deep minus. And I‚Äôm struggeling to keep my self-confidence up despite of unsuccess not dependant on me.  
But today I see the light at the end of tunnel. I have got many different business options and solved problems with suppliers. Next week I will finalise my first orders and get first breakthrough with things I have started during last year.  
So, my first year of enterpreneurship has tought me so many new things and made be surprised how much my thinking/behaving/decision making process/time management/prioritisation etc can change just because I‚Äôm not getting ‚Äúsafe‚Äù regular salary but I need to fight for every penny for myself.  
All my old friends who staid in my home country thinking I have wonderful new life ![üôÇ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/svg/1f642.svg) Yes, I have but as you said behind this beauty is lot of struggling and hard work and permanent reminder ‚ÄúI can do it, I will have success!‚Äù :). The success I‚Äôll finaly get is extremely sweet and extremely good to my Ego! ![üôÇ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/svg/1f642.svg)  
Thank you Aziz to bring the topic!

Wish you Peace,

Its very encouraging that you kept following your vision. I also would like to share that while currently I am planning to establish my own education club, I also confront with many people say WHAT ARE YOU DOING??? and some ENCOURAGING. The latter type are mostly ENTREPRENEURS themselves where as the others are job type.

People say not to follow my aims but do a job instead, but the more I hear this the more I get stuborn.

I hope that what I want to achieve would be a successful venture, no doubt i would also have hardships but with proper plan it can be reduced to considerable level.

Thanks for nice videos and story. All the best.

I can personally relate to your story! There‚Äôs an ocean out there about internet marketing and it‚Äôs very easy to sink as there‚Äôre a lot of people out there who are not sincere about their products. From surface, it looks like they‚Äôre out to help you but as you said, when you do get their products, it‚Äôs a disaster and before you know you‚Äôre in debt. But perseverance pays out. I wish everyone on your blog nothing but success and definitely Aziz is a great resource!!!

Keep up the good work bro.

Thanks for the post you shared. My dear friend, every body has a story in his life and is interested to come with a financial freedom but some succeed and some do not.In my opinion they‚Äôre only living for themselves. What is the most powerful thing I saw in your letter is your spirit and your dream for a change in the lives of others who wish to come up with some financial freedom but fail.Let‚Äôs hope you achieve the top of your dreams. Be blessed.

Saif

I think I am following in your foot steps a little, except it is still dark for me. Glad to see someone make as well as you have.
