My parents call me self-assertive, my friends call me outspoken. My super power is the ability to teach and explain things simply, hence I apply my super powers at [iLoveCoding.org](https://ilovecoding.org)

## What drives me?
---
What do we humans want? We just want to matter.

Thats what I want too. I want to spend my life such that I leave this place better than I found it. I am a very blessed individual. I was born in an educated family, to level headed parents in a beautiful country. None of which is my accomplishment.

As they say, "90% of all your battles are won before you are born".

I got lucky and married the right girl, and am blessed with a beautiful daughter.

I am so blessed that I feel obligated to contribute my fair share to society.

## Philosophies I live by

1. If you say you can or if you say you can't either way you are right.

2. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yourself.
- Albert Einstein

3. Outcomes are not in your control, you only control the input.

4. Knowledge without action is madness, and action without knowledge is void.

5. Focus on only one thing.

6. Give people the benefit of the doubt.

7. Own less! Own like a traveler, since we are here just as travelers in this world.
- Prophet Mohammad PBUH

8. You will not achieve success unless you find patience with the thing you dislike the most.
- Imam Ali Ibne Abi Talib

9. Do not advice on something you yourself do not do.
- Inspired by a story of Prophet Mohammad PBUH

10. Speak from your own experience only. Do not give advice or opinion that you have heard from others and not validated yourself.
