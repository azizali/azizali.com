My parents call me self-assertive, my friends call me outspoken. My super power is the ability to teach and explain things simply, hence I apply my super powers at [iLoveCoding.org](https://ilovecoding.org)

## What drives me?
---
What do we humans want? We just want to matter.

Thats what I want too. I want to spend my life such that I leave this place better than I found it. I am a very blessed individual. I was born in an educated family, to level headed parents in a beautiful country. None of which is my accomplishment.

As they say, "90% of all your battles are won before you are born".

I got lucky and married the right girl, and am blessed with a beautiful daughter.

I am so blessed that I feel obligated to contribute my fair share to society.

## Philosophies I live by
---
1. If you say you can or if you say you can't either way you are right.

2. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yourself.
*-- Albert Einstein*

3. Outcomes are not in your control, you only control the input.

4. Knowledge without action is madness, and action without knowledge is void.
*-- Imam Al-Ghazali*

5. Focus on only one thing.

6. Give people the benefit of the doubt.

7. Own less! Own like a traveler, since we are here just as travelers in this world.
*-- Prophet Mohammad PBUH*

8. You will not achieve success unless you find patience with the thing you dislike the most.
*-- Imam Ali Ibne Abi Talib*

9. Do not advice on something you yourself do not do.
*-- Inspired by a story of Prophet Mohammad PBUH*

10. Speak from your own experience only. Do not give advice or opinion that you have heard from others and not validated yourself.

## Problems worth solving
---
Here are some of the problems I notice often and I think they are worth solving:

- Access to free drinkable water. Non commercialization of water
  I believe water should be free, just like air. Okay okay, I get it that there is cost for cleaning and transportation and I am okay that the maintenance cost is bared by everyone using the water. However I dislike the idea of the commercialization of water.

- Traffic on roads.
  My idea of solving this is not via making better infrastructure. I think their is a lot of waste on the road. 90% of people drive a car with the capacity of 5 alone. Thats wasted fuel, energy, space and depreciation of the car.

- Recycling
  I believe we use plastic accessively. Forget that part, I believe 80% of all the materials which are recyclable are not recycled. We just put it in garbage cans. Also we throw away food which can be otherwise biodegradable.

*I understand that there are bigger issues in our world than the above. These are some that come to my attention often and hence wanted to list*
