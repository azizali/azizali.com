On an everyday basis, I use Macbook Pro 2013, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Intel Core i5 2.4 GHz, and Google Chrome as my browser.

### when I am **programming**
---
- ##### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  VS Code is my goto text-editor these days, I have been a fan of Sublime Text in the past, but VS Code is better. I like it particularly since its free, has great shortcuts, integrated terminal, and great syntax highlighting for the technologies I use. I think Sublime Text is still noticably faster if you have large files.

- ##### Javascript
  Javascript is the most popular and versatile programming language. I use it for most (if not all) of my sofware engineering projects.

- ##### React.js
  I use React.js and Redux these days to create web application front-ends. I like React since its simple. You just create components and just use plain Javascript. Coming from a Angular 1.x background, I really appreciate that its simpler to troubleshoot as well.

- ##### Redux
  Redux is a good complement to React.js. I must have for medium-large application. I like its feature that there is only one state, however I do not like that extra files of actions and reducers that need to be created.

- ##### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  Helps me quickly scaffold web and mobile apps. When I want to customize the look of my apps, its easy to do it with it as well. AzizAli.com, Qitch.com, iLoveCoding.org and many of my other projects use Bootstrap.

- ##### [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) / [Loopback](https://loopback.io/)
  I use either of them for building Web APIs. iLoveCoding Web APIs are built with Loopback.

### when I am **designing websites and art**
---

- ##### [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/)
  For just $49.99 (one-time price) its a great alternative to Adobe Photoshop. I have tried Pixelator, Gimp and some others, and found Affinity Photo to be the best option for me.

  Adobe Photoshop is $19/month, and Affinity Photo is $49.99. Thats a clear winner.

### when I am **blogging**
---

- ##### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
  I am new to Jekyll, AzizAli.com is migrated over to Jekyll from wordpress. I am not 100% sold on it, lets see.
