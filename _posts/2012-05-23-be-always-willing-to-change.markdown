One of my personal philosophy is to ALWAYS IMPROVE. We learn everyday, we are exposed to new experiences in life and our old beliefs get out dated at times. If that is the case, our actions and habits are outdated as well.

Why not improve 1% every single day. When you do, by the end of the year you will be 37x better than today.
