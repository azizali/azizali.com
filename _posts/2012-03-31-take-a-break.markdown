Another study done on the performance of the top 1% people, they took a bunch of tennis players and examined them.
They noticed that equally skilled players might produce radically different results. The difference was that the ones performed better would mentally and physically recover themselves.immediately after making a shot. They had a "take a break" mechanism built right into their game.
Lesson learnt: try to completely disconnect from work after fully focused chunk of work
