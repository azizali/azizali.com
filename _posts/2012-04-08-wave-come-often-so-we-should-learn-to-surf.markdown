Surfers prepare themselves and practice hours so they can find a good wave and ride on it.

Opportunity spotting is no different. On the verge of personal computing, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, Oracle and many others made their fortunes. They rode on the wave.

When print publications were going digital, many smart companies like Mashable, The verge, Smashing Magazine etc. pursued digital delivery of quality content and formed editorial teams that can deliver quality content fast.

When tech startups were becoming hot, Paul Graham and others created incubators to finance and mentor startups in return for equity in the company.

When mobile was becoming hot, many companies got equipped with app development platforms to serve other businesses with launching mobile.solutions.

Waves of revolution come often, its our job to practice surfing, and enjoy the ride when the wave comes.
