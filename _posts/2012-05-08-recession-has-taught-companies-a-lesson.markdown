There was a time when large corporations would hire a senior management person who could smooth talk. Talk big and make people under him/her do all the actual work.

We all know that model is flawed.

Today, the job postings say that they want a person who can talk strategy and also go implement it. The companies want to see results. No talk and, no numbers that represent the wrong story, but only results that represent the bottom line.

Now that's how its done!
