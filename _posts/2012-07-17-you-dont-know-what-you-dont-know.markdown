Simple concept "You don't know what you don't know!" But we fall trap for it everytime when our need to be right arises.

When we are hiring, leading, arguing, buying or selling, we judge the opposite party based on our prior experience.or preconceived notion. Btw it is scientifically proved that humans fool themselves and make believes based on incomplete data. Only the professionals consciously look for the complete data.

We should consciously make a habit to listen more, not judging, but to find the data which validates or invalidates our beliefs
