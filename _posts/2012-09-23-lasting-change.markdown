If you plant a tree, it will give fruit and shade for years; even after you die. If you educate a child, that child will be more capable to contribute to society and raise his children to do the same. If you give advise to a struggling entrepreneur with a worthy cause, that may just help create lasting change for society.

I try to never skip such opportunity when they arise.
