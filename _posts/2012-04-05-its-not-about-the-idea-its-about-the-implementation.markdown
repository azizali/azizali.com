Often aspiring entrepreneurs think of a business idea and think that its too great that the world should pay them for their idea and recognize their excellence for coming up with that idea.

I am blogging here to tell you that ideas are just multipliers of how well the idea is executed. ([Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/), author of "[Anything You Want](http://sivers.org/a)" and Founder of CD Baby explains that idea are justÂ multipliers)

Let me illustrate a few very mediocre ideas, When you read these ideas, please rate them as good or bad and consider if you would launch such a website with these ideas:

Idea A) A marketplace where people buy and sell everything for $5
Idea B) A virtual social network, where people can make 3D avatar and run their life
Idea C) A website where users build and run farms
Idea D) Sell shoes online

To me, all of these ideas are not that great because:

Idea A) Whats so special about $5? why should I limit people to sell only stuff for $5?
Idea B) What?? that sounds stupid.
Idea C) Come again?
Idea D) Nice idea but, most users want to try the shoes, hold it, feel it and then buy them!

Although all of those ideas are kinda mediocre they are mega successes. These ideas are actually implemented and are now called:

Idea A) Fiverr.com (194th most visited site on earth - according to Alexa)
Idea B) IMVU.com (50 Million registered members)
Idea C) Farmville Facebook App (Used by 80 Million users)
Idea D) Zappos.com (Sells $1 billion worth of merchandise per year)

Despite of major flaws in these ideas they were mega hits because of the company's amazing execution.

If you are married to an idea, stop focusing on the idea, focus on its implementation. Implementation means all aspects of how you bring the idea to life and to market.
