Often smart people are dumb enough to be threatened by other smart people. The smart boss thinks that the new smart candidate he is interviewing is going to be a superstar and will make him look bad.

Everyone is going to appreciate and recognize the new guy and the boss is going to be seen as not that precious.

The new guy will recognise and point out loopholes in the current system/work, hence further making the boss's work look insignificant and not top notch.

Hence many smart people sabotage their interpersonal and professional success by not welcoming anyone smarter than them.

Firstly, is that fear really real? Or is it just False Evidence Appearing Real?

This attitude stems from scares mentality, and ultimately everyone looses.
