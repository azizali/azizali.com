If you interview a handful of people about their financial goal, you will discover that most of them do not have one. The ones that do, will give you a vague number. If you ask them what will they do after they achieve that financial benchmark, you will discover that they did not even believe in themselves achieving that goal in the first place and hence never thought about what they would do after they achieved that goal. Some may talk about retiring and moving on to other things.

In a world where most of us do not know which direction we are going, there are others who know precisely.

Sure Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerburg could have stopped at the million dollar stage (Like most of us) but they didn't. I guess the drivers of such mega successes simply dare to dream bigger.
