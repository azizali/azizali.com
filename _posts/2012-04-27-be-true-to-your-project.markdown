Artist(programmers, painters, architects, entrepreneurs etc.) pride themselves and trust that they will produce quality art. But then some of them intentionally lower their standards and produce something that is going to be JUST ACCEPTABLE liked by the masses, for everyone, commercial, mass appeal. When you do that, you firstly tax your art and produce not at your best.

Disconnect from what your boss, and your competitors will think of your art, focus on what you think is right and if your art will serve the people its made for. Become true to those two things YOU and YOUR USER and your boss and the competitors and the media and the investors will start listening to you rather than the other way round.
