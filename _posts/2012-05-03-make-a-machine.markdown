When you make a good machine, it works perfectly and gives us standard output if the input is consistent as well.

You need a few technicians to maintain and improve the machine and you can rent out your machine to the masses.

Here is the fun part. Web machines i.e. Some web Apps and solutions are machines. Google made Google Search, a machine that spits out standard predictable results and they let people use the machine for free

They created Google AdWords, a machine that connects buyers and sellers of ads. Its just a machine totally unconventional from how online ads were sold, but its a tool that both parties like to use and they take a cut.

Facebook is a machine. They got messaging, profile, social tools and anyone can use them. Its a standard tool.

Same goes for eBay, Craigslist. You get the point

Amazon was not a machine. They were a store, that means for every product, they had to manually put the product up, have an inventory in the warehouse and do manual labor to deliver the product to the customer. But then the evolved to the machine model.

People can sell their products on amazon. Amazon started renting out their WebStore, Storage, and Publishing solution, which is a machine.

The reason I am explaining this to you is that, if you want to become rich faster, focus on a business that involves on you making a machine that can be used by the masses. You can scale without adding too much man labor or cost as the machine is used more.

You make the machine once, and keep updating and maintaining it.
