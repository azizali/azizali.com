I have noticed countless times that the top 5% people perform their skill almost effortlessly. I enjoy watching singing competitions - It happens many times that the best song gets recognition while at the same time the judges recognize that the song was performed as if it was sung effortlessly, with peace, with harmony and congruence at all levels.

Why does it happen that the best sales person always gets the most sales, while you work your butt off and not come even close?

Why does the genius student work less hard than you but still get a better grade?

Doesn't this happen way to often to you as well. Is it just me, or is it really like this?

Well I have come to believe after listening to this book [With Winning in Mind by Lanny Bassham](http://www.amazon.com/With-Winning-Mind-Mental-Management/dp/1885221479), that the top 5% people have a passion for the process. Sure, they want the outcome - more sales, better grades, amazing performance, etc but they do not focus on the outcome while they are at work. Instead they focus on the process, the journey, the details of how they perform their task.

If you want to put a nail inside a wall, you just need to focus on the process of hammering on shot well at a time. With a few strikes the nail will be in the wall!
