If something is happening for a long enough time, we think its normal, we may not like it but it is considered NORMAL in our lives. Let me give you a few examples.



	
  * Having poor economy is a norm

	
  * Being in debt is a norm

	
  * Loosing a job is a norm

	
  * Loosing money on Wall Street is a norm

	
  * Children misbehaving and calling their parents bad names and disrespecting is a norm


There is a proverb in Urdu, which in English transates "one bad fish can pollute an entire pond"

Similarly, one person at a time we lowered our standards as a society and now all the above bullets are considered a norm, although those acts are totally unacceptable.
