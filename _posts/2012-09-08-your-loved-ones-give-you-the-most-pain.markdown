Parents worldwide stress over the matter of their kids. Wether they are 5 or 50. If your significant other doesn't respect you, you get frustrated. If someone else doesn't respect, who cares?

If a stranger lies to you, you get angry and forget. If a loved one does the same, it's a permenent memory.

If a stranger is over weight, you call them fat. If your loved one is, you spend all your energy focus and money to help them.

We are so deeply connected with them that their lose is our lose and hence their wins or ours 

Our loved ones give us the most pain, trouble and pleasure.
