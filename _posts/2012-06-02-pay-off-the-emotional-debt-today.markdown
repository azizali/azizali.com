We all have those relationships where we chose to ignore that person when in the same room. We avoid them, we passionately go on and on about how they did us wrong. We see every good thing they do to us in the light of the bad thing they did to us in our past.

Overall, we do not forgive them. Our mind has to work hard to activily avoid, ignore and talk bad about this person. It doesn't help anyone. Your friends are sick of you talking about that person, and you are staying frustrated not enjoying the moment you have. Overall that person owns you, because he owns your mind, your mind is occupied by their thought.

Let the grieve go, forgive him, or ask for forgiveness. No one is going to loose. Pay off that heavy emotional debt with a simple apology or forgiveness.
