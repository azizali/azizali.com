Sometimes it is not about what you do, but why you do it.

You may tell a lie, to save an innocent live.

You may also tell a lie to harm an innocent live. Action is the same, bit the why/intention behind the action is worlds apart.

An applicant may want the job for money, another may want it to just get away from its precious employer, another may want it because she is passionate about the job.

The why behind the applicant will make a huge difference in performance and how long the employee stays with the company.
