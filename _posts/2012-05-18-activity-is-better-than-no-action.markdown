In an interview Donald Trump was asked what was he thinking when he lost everything and was in millions of dollars in debt. He replied I didn't have time to think, I was busy working.

It's facinating that the mega successful focus on the process and are always in motion while others think about thinking and second guess their plans so much so that they take no action.
