My brother and I have the same phone and the same phone charger. I ordered an extra charger for my office and the day it arrived in the mail, my brother broke his charger. Since this charger of mine was an extra one for me, he conveniently took it for his use.

Although the charger was literally under $3, I spent a lot of time choosing the right kind. I had invested my emotional energy in buying that charger, and when my brother took this charger away, I felt this was unfair.

I could easily reorder this charger and wait a few more days, but that was not my first thought.

Money is not really the most expensive investment, emotions are.

That is why we would spend our wealth and savings in a business idea, or for a cause, or for a person,  because our emotional connection and investment in that idea, cause or person is far more important than money.
