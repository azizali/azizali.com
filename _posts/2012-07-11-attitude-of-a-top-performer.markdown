I was watching a MMA fight and right after the fight finishes, a guy with the mic comes up to winner asks a few questions and then moves on to the looser and asks him a bunch of questions.

Many times the question being asked to both the contenders is why they were getting the beating in certain point of the match. And always without exception, the athlete will give them a plausible explanation but then immediately say "That is not an excuse, just an explanation" inclining that that is not any reason for loosing but an opportunity to improve.

This attitude is not limited to MMA, take any sport or any top performer and they will always go back to what they can change with themselves to improve.

A prof. golfer will not blame the wind or the weather, the prof. shooter will not blame the equipment, and the boxer will not blame the coach. They will find a process improvement they need to do in their art and they will go and work on it.
