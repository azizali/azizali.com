They say that when you work out, never do the same exercise, consistently. i.e. do different bicep exercises. Why, this helps confuse your muscles into not really adapting a certain muscle group into a consistent motion. When you do multiple exercises for one muscle group, the muscle grows much stronger.

Similarly, we are creatures of habit, we wake up at consistent times, we eat similar kinds of food and we live in one or two places. This makes our mind narrow and non versatile.

Its always good to take off and visit another city, so we experience different culture, food, language, and places to live.
