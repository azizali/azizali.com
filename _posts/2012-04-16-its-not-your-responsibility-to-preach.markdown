Not the entire world is your student, nor is the entire world your children. Some people just have the generic feeling that they have the obligation to correct people.

These people have 87,649 pet peeves and the second they smell someone do something that is one of their pet peeves, they go in defensive mode and start talking like a lawyer. Sometimes they start talking like a preacher or Dr Phil for say ;)

Although with the purest intention in heart, the external behavior of preaching does not do good to anyone. Children will not listen to parents because they generally do not welcome too much lecturing. Parents have lack of patience and understanding of their children and they seek the shortest and the fastest way to get instant gratification to correct their child's behavior. They preach, and if that doesn't work, they scold.

Does that strategy even sound sensible?
Alas, 99% of us, do just that.

Children will find their role models based on their values. If they value becoming physically powerful is honourable, they will follow a wrestler or boxer. If they think making the world a better place by making it healthy is important, the child will follow a philanthropist who is doing just that!

If you want to make someone better, seed the correct values in them! It will take a ton of watering, caring and nurturing and time, but the fruit will sprout automatically. (Given that the person you are trying to help honors the principles on which the value is based.)
