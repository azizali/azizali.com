You can not be all things.

Michael Jordan played professional baseball, worked his butt off but was not a rockstar at it. He plays golf and is close to average at it. But Jordan is the king of basketball.

The question is that would you know Muhammad Ali if he was a professional singer?

Would you know Atif Aslam, Lady Gaga or Michael Jackson if they were professional boxer?

What makes you think that you are going to kick-butt at something that you just pondered upon and are excited about for the time being?

You don't suck at everything, you just need to find the thing where you are designed to be a rockstar.

P.S. I use the word Rockstar often. For me Rockstar is a kind of person who is the best of the best of the best at a particular task/field/position.
