I am a huge proponent for openness and transparency, because it just makes life easier for everyone in the long run. Here are a few examples.

- Russia adapted the communism culture and the rest of the smart nations adapted democracy. Who is more far ahead?

- the internet made the world more transparent allowing nations, to oppose bad country policies openly and strongly.

- subcultures of programmers and geeks created opensource hardware, software and now education that accelerates progress.

- Seth Godin's domino project, brings back power to the author and not to the big publishers.

- Udemy.com made education open where anyone can teach anything.

- Kickstarter, indiegogo, Profounder, and Kiva are making funding easy and open, where the many decide which project is worth funding.

It's time, our government become truly open, and transparent.
