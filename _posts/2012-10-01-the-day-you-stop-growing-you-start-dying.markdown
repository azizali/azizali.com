Most people today hate their jobs, not because the jobs are bad, but because they a virus in them, commonly known as complaining. Most people love complaining because it gives them the opportunity to pick a common evil, and a chance to socialize and create bond with their peers. It gives them the opportunity to point fingers and not take the responsibility to do something about it.

When the problem lies there, why work on ourselves, right?

Hence most people stop growing, because they don't want to, or they don't want to admit that they need to.
