We all get caught up in the trap of:



	
  * I'll do it tomorrow

	
  * lets talk about it

	
  * Its a big decision

	
  * And so forth


In other words we delay making decisions!

If you want to launch a website, code up a feature, or remove a certain element, we want to just postpone it to a later date! WHY??

There are several reasons for that. One major reason behind this is that we think that the task it going to take too long!

How much time does it take to send that email, post that job opening, upload the photo album, or just download that database!

In most cases min 5 minutes - max 30 minutes, and you can scratch that task of the list.
