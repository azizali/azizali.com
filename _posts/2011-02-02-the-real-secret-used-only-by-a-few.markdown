A few months ago I was watching a movie researching on what is truly the secret to success. With the movie "The Secret" out in the world, and our society being trained by media and deceiving hype,
<!-- more -->
that we can achieve anything and everything with simple push button solutions, we are hypnotized away from reality.

100s of Clickbank products claiming push button softwares that can make you millions, infomercials selling bogus pills and gadgets that can make you slim, and MLM sponsors showing us the dream to the perfect world luring us to join their down-line.

Where have we lost our innocence, our honesty and our integrity.

People are selling us on the dream with empty promises and claiming to have A SECRET that can magically solve our problems.

**How does that logically make any sense???**

But guess what? You and I keep on buying that Clickbank junk, that gadget from infomercials, and that expensive software that promises to deposit money in your bank account everyday!


## Come on lets GET REAL PEOPLE


We get disappointed with the results and we go back in our loop of finding yet another person who is going to sell us a magical solution. We buy from the person who tells us what we want to listen verses the honest person, like you, who is going to tell you the facts on your face.

I consult with a lot of clients and students on business and marketing, and I get repelled by people who expect me to give them a magic pill and a glass of water that can make everything perfect for them!

Yes there is a magic pill to everything! BUT it has side effects.

Desire: You wanna make money magically?
Magic Pill: Go rob a bank
Side-Effect: You will probably go to jail
Optimal Solution: Serve others through your business

Desire: You wanna loose weight and get six-packs?
Magic Pill: Go to a doctor and get a surgery
Side-Effect: Other health problems
Optimal Solution: Workout and change your eating habits

See! Its obvious to our LOGICAL brain, but alas! our EMOTIONAL brain buys that magic pill junk all day long.


## Enough of the background NOW the REAL secret


You know I won't bedazzle anything for you here. I am going to give you the straight honest to God truth!

And to make my point more solid, I got some really famous people to back me up!

Reporter: You are working so hard, recording, shooting, editing. when do you sleep?
50Cents: Sleep? Sleep is for those people who are broke! I don't sleep.

Reporter: What did you do when you went broke and millions in debt?
Donald Trump: I didn't really had time to think too much about it. I kept going, I kept meeting people and worked.

Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Sylvester Stallone, Steve Jobs, Anthony Robbins, Dan Kennedy, Jim Carry and countless other successful people, were all broke at one point in their lives struggling to make ends meet and begging to get their foot in the door.

Trump was in a debt for millions of dollars. Steve Jobs was once kicked out of his own company, Apple, and he had to leave town to save himself from embarrassment.


## This is going to Determine one's success


Let me ask you this question:

Do you think you have the courage and the strength to keep on going when your million dollar company is taken away from you?

Can you keep on going when your 100 million dollar empire falls apart and you are left with millions of dollars in debt?

The answer to that question will determine how far one goes in life.

The ability to keep on going regardless of the circumstances is the REAL secret known by ALL, but used only by the few to get all the riches one's heart desires.

No amount of SEO, PPC, partnerships, College Education, Experience, Training, Expert help is going to help you if you don't have the ability to confront your fears and weaknesses. PERIOD!

Listen! Pain is only temporary!

It may last for a minute, an hour, a day or even a year, but eventually it will be replaced by satisfaction.

But for quitters and loosers, that pain is permanent.

"The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It's as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer."
- Nolan Bushnell
