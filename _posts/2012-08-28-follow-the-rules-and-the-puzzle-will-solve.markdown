When a child gets a puzzle, she attempts to solve it with persistence with the believe that some two pieces go together, and it has to be one of them in the box. The belief comes because of the guarantee provided by the puzzle manufacturer. It's simple, straight forward and obvious.

Similarly, the world comes with a ton of puzzle pieces and its manufacturer, God guarantees certain rules that will make the puzzle solve.

We, humans have to have that believe without doubt. Just the way a child has no doubt that the puzzle manufacturers rules are going to work out in solving the puzzle, we adults need to have faith in the rules of God, do the right things and the puzzles of earth will solve.

P.S. Every game, has its rules. Some rules, like the rules of God are the basis of all rules. Not all games should be played and not all rules must be followed but the rules set by God.
