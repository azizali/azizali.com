There will be days when you will not accomplish anything. It will be though to even get your hands on your working notes or files. In the end of the day you will feel unaccomplisbed, loser and the whole world is imperfect and against you.

You feel that you have let yourself  down.

If you have that feeling, you are not alone. I am having that day today.

I just wanna let you know that its normal, and there will be another day tomorrow to ace.
