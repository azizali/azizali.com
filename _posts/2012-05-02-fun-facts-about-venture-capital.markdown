Venture capitalist does not want you to be profitable. If you have profits they want you to reinvest it in the company so you can grow faster.

VC hates dividends for tax purposes.

They want you to sell the company and they will force you to do so because that's the only way they make money.

Some VC deals may have a clause that take away your power, even if you are the majority stackholder. I.e they may prevent you to make executive decisions on hiring, partnerships etc.

They may also put in clause that may give you less cash in your hand when you sell the company.

A VC I just met today said that venture capital comes with bagage.

Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple and many others all are big because of the financial, and expert resource provided by VCs.
