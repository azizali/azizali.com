Questions are the best tool to keep us focused. Questions give us clarity. Questions stem from curiosity and lead to discovery or reassurance.

A few questions you may ask in your business might be:



	
  * Is my business idea of any help to the customers?

	
  * Does this really increase conversions?

	
  * How is that "design element" or "feature change" going to affect our brand, user experience or profitability?


A few questions you may ask in your personal life:

	
  * Is this gift going to totally surprise my spouse and bring him/her to tears due to overwhelming happiness?

	
  * What is more important, the climax of the movie, or the phone call your parents made to you in a long time (at that climax)?

	
  * When a friend asks for a favor, is it more important to simply help him happily without making her realize that you really did her a favor by taking out time, or simply chill with her and make her feel as if she has a right to get help from you because she are friends?


Questions clear the blur of feverish activity and get us right to the heart of the mater.

Ask more questions, more often, and in the proper context with the intention to make decisions which are unbiased and right.
