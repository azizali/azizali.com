Every single day, there are 879,548 guru launching in the market, re-purposing and re-spinning the content of the previous guru.

**Why is this bad? **Because the new gurus have not discovered anything new, they have not paid their dues, let alone practice what they preach. Their content has no value, since they did not go through the emotional labor of failing failing failing and then succeeding in discovering what works.

A year ago, one of my students was in the market for hiring a guru. Luckily he did not hire any of them. A few weeks ago he reported to me that all of those Guru's were gone, their websites were dead, and there was no way to contact with them.

**Lessons Learned:
**1) When the guru's did not pay their dues their message was incongruent , hence my student, and many other prospects did not feel comfortable hiring them.

2) They did not eat their own dog food (didn't practice what they preached) and hence quickly went out of business.

Mark Twain has a message for those new Gurus:

_"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.” – Mark Twain_

Find your edge, don't follow others
