Inspired by [Seth Godin's](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) persistence on writing a daily blog, combined with the idea that writing my ideas down daily could be of unimaginable value to my readers and I, I have decided to start this journey to writing a daily blog.

To keep me on track is the audio book "[Accidental Genius: Using Writing to Generate Your Best Ideas, Insight and Content](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B004BB940G&qid=1327436472&sr=1-1)"

The posts on this blog will be short and will contain insights, Aha moments and wisdom that I learn along as a student of life.

Things that greatly interest me are Business, Marketing, Psychology,Â Subcultures, and Top 1% people from all fields of life.

I am an extremely curious soul, with a high zeal for learning.

I am a reverse engineer, and I tend to look life through that lens.
