A particular person I started working with was great. He was hyper responsive, proactive and smart. Eventually the organization started to put more people under him. He went from managing 2 employees to managing 5, and this was the threshold that lead him to use big words for himself in meetings.

He started saying stuff like "I see the complete picture that no one else sees in the company" and he would always question other people's decision when it is not his expertise to make that call.

Just a simple promotion made him go from super nice to a super jerk.

Gratitude puts our attitude and altitude at leash.
