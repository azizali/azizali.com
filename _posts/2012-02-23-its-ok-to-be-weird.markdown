It's OK to sing on top of your lungs in your car, and look in the eye of your neighboring drivers while at a stop sign.

It's OK to not have a Facebook account.

It's OK to not follow sports or celebrity news.

it's OK to obsess over small things that make a huge difference.

It's OK to compete with the 300 pound gorilla.

It's OK to be seen as a boring & disengaged person, in the middle of a gossiping crowd.

Exactly the way it's OK for a turtle to race with a rabbit and win.

Society and the social norms have forced us to do so many things that make us unreal, dishonest, and frustrated.
