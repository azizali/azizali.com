Seriously.... This darn thing is the worlds top 25 most visited websites! Last time I checked, LinkedIn was at rank 23rd. Millions of users, and billions of page views... AKA lots of targeted traffic.
<!-- more -->

All of these people have something in common:
- They are business/career oriented.
- They like to network with like minded people.
- Most of them don't know how.

Heck where else can you find an organized database of a targeted group of motivated and intelligent people?

Well, I figured out a way to attract these people to do business with me, and the good part is that I get instant credibility and authority in the minds of these people.

Watch the video below to see how I get leads from LinkedIn while I build credibility and trust in my marketplace.
