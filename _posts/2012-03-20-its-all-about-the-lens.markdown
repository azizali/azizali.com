A coworker of mine went through a life changing experience in the past week. His newly born (I week old) son, Ben, was diagnosed with a rare disease, which had something to do with his arteries, such that Ben's heart had to work harder then a normal person's heart. A week old Ben was hospitalized and had some kind of operation. The chances of his survival were slim. My colleague took off from work since he was in a highly emotional state; uncertain of the fate of his son.

I began to wonder that a father has so much love for a week old son, that he can't live, breath and eat normal when the son is sick. Think about the love my dad and your dad has for you deep down in his heart, where he has seen us grow through the fun and tough times. Our dads sacrificed there normal routines, their behavior, and their entire lifestyle for us.

What do we do, when we grow up?
Leave them alone!
Visit them once in a blue moon!

There health issues, and their doctor's appointment is their problem, not ours, right?

If they need their household stuff fixed, we don't have time!

How mean are we?
How thankless or how ungrateful we become as we grow up?

Its sad

P.S. Ben is doing better day by day. I wish I could make a movie of the past week and show it to him when he grows up. Giving him a real demo of how much his parents love him. I think we all need to picture ourselves as babies, and think of the times when our parents sacrificed for us.
