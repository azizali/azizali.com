When you know nobody is watching you, you will spit on the street or liter in a public place. You would never do that if your in-laws, a cop or that person you have a crush on is watching you.

There are statistics out there that x% of people cheat with their spouse. This would never be the case if there was more transparency.

Governments of nation pass policies to either harm other nations or hand the shorter side of the stick to their own people. These policies would never pass if there is more transparency in the world. People of one nation would stand against their own government if they tries to unfairly harm another country.

A cop would never misuse his power if he knew he is being recorded on camera and that video is going to go on YouTube.

Internet has done that for us, created transparency. So we can together choose the artist who doesn't have a big record label contract or that book publishing deal or that fancy connections and make him a star, purely because his art is precious.

I love truth and transparency, and that is why I am working on DaysToDomination.com where entrepreneurs can find rate and review business solutions, mentors ans educational material.

Just like Yelp is for restaurants. DaysToDomination is for business apps, courses and mentors.
