All business owners and startups ask this question "How do I get more users/customers"

Here is the answer:

Look for places where you customer hangs out. Whether it be physical places or online websites. Think of places where your customer goes:



	
  * Before he/she buys your product

	
  * During the buying process

	
  * After the purchase


Also products/services that are complimentary to your product are also great places to find your customers.
