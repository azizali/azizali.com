I was at a workshop today and we did some.group excercises that required us all to be silent. It was interesting to see that bu doing this, there was no power heirarchy. Usually people.portray their power through voice. There was also less.disagreements since people took the time to process each others visual/drawing messages and emphatasized with them vs the usual quick.to getting to.conclusions approach.

Silence and less talking gives time to process and hence more clarity.
