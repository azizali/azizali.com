I heard an entrepreneur mentor give a speech on a particular topic. I loved it and made my mind towards taking action on his advice. I was pumped, and then the next mentor comes up and gives his speech on the same subject. Sounds awesome but here is the deal. They had conflicting opinion on some aspects of the advice. 

What do I do? Do I take action on the first mentors advice or the second mentors advice?

The thing is that every human is different, and what works for one personality type, does not work for the other.

I gotta sleep on it a bit and be brutally honest with me on certain points.

I need to define my criteria and rank the order of my preferences and then brutally use that framework to see what the best option is for me as defined by my own criteria.

Let's give the gut feeling a better process so it gets less muddy.
