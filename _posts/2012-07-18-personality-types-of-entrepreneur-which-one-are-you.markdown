Entrepreneurs come in a few flavors. 

There are BUILDERS, who like to build entities from the ground up, like Bill Gates.

There are OPPORTUNISTS, like Richard Branson who like to jump on opportunities, regardless of how unknown the space.

There are SPECIALISTS like Warren Buffett who stick with a certain field for a longtime and build their business that way.

And run there are INVENTORS like Steve Wozniak of Apple, or Thomas Edison who like to invent stuff.

Which one are you? Check it out at http://bosidna.com.
