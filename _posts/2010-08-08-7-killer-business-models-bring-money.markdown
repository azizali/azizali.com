As a student of marketing, business development, leadership and sales, I have seen many business models existing around us. A few might surprise you, because Bill Gates taped into one to make his billions.<!-- more -->
This will truly open your eyes towards the possibilities there are to make enormous amounts of money. If people can make billions from basic ideas, we sure can make our millions if we get it 1/1000th of it right. Lets check it out:


### 1. Retail Distribution model


Here  you establish relationships with distributors who can help get your  product on retail shelves in front of thousands upon thousands of  consumers. The key here is to sell your idea to these distributors.


### 2. Subscription based model


Magazines,  newspapers, online membership websites usually use this model to get  the customer ONCE, and get them to pay on a weekly/monthly basis.  Remember! the most Â expensive task in any business is usually new  customer acquisition. Subscription based business models, by design make  multiple sales to a single customer, making them one of the most stable  & predictable amount of revenue.


### 3. Infomercials model


Infomercials  are basically product demonstration of an item that has a darn good  price. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent in commercial  production and buying airtime. You think they make money on those cheap  $20 stuff?

If  you have ever called in to order these cheapys and summed up the dollar  amount of all the stuff they try to up-sell you on, while you are in the  order process on the phone, you already know the money is made on the up-sell products and not on the $20 cheapy product. The front end product  is just a lost leader to get you in a buying mode. Once you are in this  mode, selling other useless expensive things is far more easier.


### 4. Affiliate Marketing model


Affiliate  marketing is basically an online sales person who is purely paid based  on performance. An affiliate marketer has greater control on how  creatively & cost effectively sell a product. Many websites and  vendors create product depending 100% on third party affiliates to get  them sales.
The  vendor is happy since she is getting sales person who only get paid on  performance, and affiliates are happy since they know how to make sales,  without having to worry about customer service, product creation,  delivery and other related stuff.


### 5. Social Media Marketing model


This  is the online version of networking, with the added benefit of open  communication that other people can join, read, share, analyze, and  rate. This is truly a phenomenon in human history, where content is  created, rated, and distributed by humans. And the same humans decide  which platform(facebook, mySpace, LinkedIn, Youtube, etc) they like the  most to carry out these activities. Billion dollar companies are tapping  into social media communications to understand, and serve their  audience better.

The  fact is that human behavior is getting much more easier to understand  online, as it is in offline. Companies like Comcast, Google, and  Microsoft are keeping an eye on these free-flow communication on these  platforms to get a better feel of their customers deeper needs and  desires. pretty cool stuff!


### 6. Joint Venture model


This  is my favorite business model. It creates win-win-win relationships, it  sometimes almost guarantees success, and it has already made 100s of  billions per company. let me explain:

The  vending machine person formed a joint venture with a shopping mall to  place its machines in their location. This guarantees automated sales to  the vending machine provider, and its quick easy money for the shopping  mall owner.

TCF  bank joints ventures with Jewel Osco and establishes its banking  location inside the shop. This way TCF bank targets, customers of Jewel  Osco, who find TCF bank convenient since its inside their shopping store  already. Win Win Win for all.

Microsoft  joint ventures with almost all computer hardware provider to provide  software (windows) for their machines. Turns out in a few years, the  whole world is dependent on this software.

pretty  eye opening right? Its interesting to see how we humans have evolved  business, and we have come up with solutions to sell more and more stuff  to our fellow humans.

Now you have to decide, which model is right for you.
