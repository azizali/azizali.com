Excuses reduces the burden on your shoulder convincing yourself to take a chill because it is not you. If you are late to a meeting you say

"I apologize, I am late sorry but the traffic was horrible"

nope you should have stopped at the word sorry.

Do not put the blame on traffic or any other external source because ultimately, you had the power to plan ahead and get in the car earlier.
