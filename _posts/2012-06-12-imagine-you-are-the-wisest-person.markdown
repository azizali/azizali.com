Imagine you are 95 years old. You are wise and you are giving advice to your younger self, because now at 95 you see the bigger picture. What would you advise yourself?

Would you advise yourself to:



	
  * Quit your job

	
  * Pursue a dream

	
  * Make that phone call

	
  * Make thatÂ apology

	
  * Spend more time with your parents




Do you tell yourself: "I am going to pursue my dream _after..._"







Would the 95 year old you advise you to do otherwise?


I am simply asking you to really feel as if you are the 95 year old wise person today. Advise yourself today, not at 95.
