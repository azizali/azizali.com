I read about Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook talking about how she leaves work at 5:30pm consistently. Great to have a work life balance.

I heard Tim Ferriss talking about working less and focusing on the 20% work that produces 80% result.

Again, great advice. But there is a problem.

There is a stage where you can chilax and still do well, unfortunately neither Sheryl, nor Tim chilaxed and went home on time, in the.early stage when they were nobodys. They worked there bud off since they were not successful then.

As a person aspiring to make a mark on the world, the work less advice will not get you the results you are seeking.
