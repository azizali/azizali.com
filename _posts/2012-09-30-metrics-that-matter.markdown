In the tech startup world, people want to portray themselves as big. They measure their success by the amount of money raised, and the number of employees working in the team.

But what matters is if the company is profitable and providing real value.

Where is that metric in the conversation? 37Signals is one of the most respected and popular software-as-a-service companies with mere 35 employees. They can hire far more, but why do? 

Optimize for the metrics that matter, like happiness :)
