It is so fasinating to notice that, we over estimate how much work we do. If you want to start a project, do work out, or anything. If we just think about doing it, we feel progress and we get a sense of satisfaction. Often times we feel exhausted just thinking about that thing as if we actually went out and did the work itself. The sad part is that, this feeling keeps us from actually doing the work.

That is the reason why there is a whole market of education junkies. Internet Marketing Junkies, Get Rich Quick info junkies, MBA types, and the list goes on. People like attending seminars and info sessions because just sitting on their butt they think they achieved something.

I work with a very smart guy, who thinks we make progress just by attending meetings. He feels so happy in the end of every meeting and explicitly says that we accomplished a lot just by talking.

This is counter productive and if you see yourself doing this, go on a information diet, or a keep not of how much production you do versus, thinking. That realization will hopefully actually make you do actual production.
