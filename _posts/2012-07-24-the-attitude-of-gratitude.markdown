Humans are shamelessly greedy. If we have okay food, we want lavish food, then we want to show off that we are well off enough to afford the lavish food. Soon we want the shiny car and then that bigger house. Then we want to renovate so our neighbors can envy us.

The one thing that we all should crave is "enough"

And always thank God for what we have been blessed with.
