I am fascinated by human behavior and psychology. How humans fool themselves often and come up with logical reasons behind their irrational and emotional decisions.

I am listening to this audio book "Thinking Fast and Slow" where the author talking about how our decisions are biased because we highly trust our immediate memory to make decisions. Only if we cannot come up with quick answers, we rely on our more thorough processing capability.

Consider this exercise: Are there more words in the English language that has the letter K as the first letter (i.e K*****) OR more words that have K as the third alphabet(i.e **K****).

Most people would respond K as the first letter, because our mind can more easily comeup with words _**starting**_ with ANY alphabet, rather than thinking of words where the alphabet is in the middle.

Just ONE example of how we use the fastest access and small sample of resources to make strong decisions that can be wrong because of its bias.
