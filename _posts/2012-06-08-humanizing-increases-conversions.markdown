If I wanted to sell a software or a consulting gig or advertising, I can sell it online or sell it person. I have to bring 1000 interesting eyeballs to my website to make 20 sales. But if I met each prospect in person I would have made 400 sales.

The sales message is the same, in-person and online but In-person communication has exponentially more impact. It builds trust faster and the feedback loop is closed faster as well.

The dilemma is that in-person sales are more time consuming and scaling would be in consistent and expensive. With web sales, scaling is as easy in increasing your marketing/advertising spend and the results are relatively consistent.

Solution, do a hybrid of both.
