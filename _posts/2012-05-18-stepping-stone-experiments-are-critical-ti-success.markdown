Failure is only when you refuse to stand back up after you have fallen.

Remember when you learned to walk.. oh you don't remember? Me neither.

Well, remember when you first attempted to ride the bike, without training wheels?
I remember that one, I had a bike larger than the size appropriate for my age and my legs didn't reach the ground. It was my elder brothers bike, I think.

I fell so many times that day that I deformed my bike and had countless scratches on my body. I don't even remember any pain. All I remember is that I wanted to ride the bike so bad, that I tried for two days until I started to get a hang of it.

As children we are unafraid to experiment and lose, and as we grow older, the slightly older kids start making fun of us about our experiments, slowly baking out all the courage to experiment out of us.

Today most elders are afraid of experiments, they still remember the pain of being left out of the crowd or making fun of. For us that is failure, although in real terms, its just an experiment. Because experiments are done to test and learn, learning something didn't work is not failure, its just an experiment. Failure is only when you stop experimenting to find the result you are seeking.

And it hardly happens that you find your solution in the first attempt. Stop thinking of your failed attempts as absolute failures, they are simply stepping stone experiments/lessons to success.
