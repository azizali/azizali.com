No matter how confident and experienced your contractor/provider is.



	
  * If they say its going to take X number of hours, multiply that by 3

	
  * If they say its going to take $X, multiply that by 2


Its a good rule of thumb, and these reality is not just for your contractors, its for you as well. ;)
