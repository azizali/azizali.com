Scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs and other artists, poke the box to see what happens. That is how they experiment and make discoveries. If something screws up, they attempt to clean up the mess and learn even more in the process. 

It's better to apologize (if things go bad), than to ask permission to poke the box. The upside and the learning opportunity is often worth it to take that risk.
