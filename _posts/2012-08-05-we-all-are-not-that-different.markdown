As we were growing up, we read news and heard on TV about successful people. The kid that invented something, the teenager who made millions, the women who sold an idea or that person that wrote a killer book.

No matter what is success for us, we always thought of them to have a perfect life. We somehow believe that those people are so perfect that they never fight with their spouse, or they have all the perfect friends and mentors.

But thanks to today's era of reality shows, biographies, interviews and other detailed third party unbiased, unflashy analysis, we know that even those people we envy, think about their kids while going to sleep. Worry about their parents, cry when they loose someone, and feel like throwing their phone when frustrated.
