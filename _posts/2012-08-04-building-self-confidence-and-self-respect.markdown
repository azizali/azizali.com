I have found that, when I break my own promises; promises that I made to myself, I trust myself less and hence have less respect for my words.

If we don't trust our own self, how can we be confident in convincing others of our worth and integrity.

Make less, and smaller commitments, but fulfill it without exception, every time. Step your commitments up a notch after you are consistently having smaller successes
