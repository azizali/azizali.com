A university prof. Asked his students to NOT THINK OF A WHITE BEAR for 5 minutes. Simple task, but they could not do.it, the act of doing something, while making an exception, the exception is still in the brain to process.

Similarly people who go on a diet and exempt themselves from.eating chocolate or cupcakes, crave those.things because they are.conciously forcing themselves away from.those things.

No wonder why people who go on diet gain their weight back when they get off their diet and gain  additional pounds than what they originally had.

It's much more productive to say that I will eat healthy than to say I will avoid chocolate. It's much easier to be 5 minutes early, than to avoid being late.
