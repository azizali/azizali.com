Corporations have a policy of being faceless. They spend enormous amount of money on brand advertisement so the consumers recognize their brand or associate with a particular music, catch phrase, color and/or logo

They later realized that the human touch is far more sticky than that of music, catch phrase, color or logo; so they employed celebrities to do commercials for them. Actors, musicians, and athletes were their brand embasadors to push more products leveraging their human touch.

Companies like geico used the gecko as their face, which is a good spin at humanizing the company.

Then some genius companies thought of genuinely humanizing their brands where the company's leader would come in front of the camera to be the face of the company. (The cheapest and the most effective path)

Tony Hsieh of Zappos, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steve Jobs of Apple became the face of their company early on. Mark Zuckerberg and others followed the leap on being the face of the company.

Google officially designs and launches April fool days pranks, which makes us all feel that they care about our happiness, they see us as humans and amazingly we believe that fun amd human-people (synonym of real people) work behind our Google screen.
