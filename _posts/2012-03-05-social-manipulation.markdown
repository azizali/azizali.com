A couple of weeks ago I was having a business conversation with aÂ colleague, and I expressed to him that I believe in developing products and value proposition first and then designing the sales process. A few weeks later he made fun of me in front of other co-workers laughingly saying "Aziz is product guy... ha ha ha"

He got the attention of the crowd for the time being and managed to raise his social rank a tiny bit as well.

How many times has it happened to you that the person you trusted, openly ridicules you in front of others and puts your message in the wrong light?

They are not your friends!
