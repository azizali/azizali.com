Reaching goals while maintaining integrity is true success!



	
  * Its easy to kiss ass, and get favors.

	
  * Its easy to cheat in an exam and score higher

	
  * Its easy to steal and get money

	
  * Its easy to betray your partners, and break your commitments to get the ahead


But did you really get ahead? Was that a long-term strategic move or a short-term stupid move?

It's difficult to not do all of the above since it requires working out your integrity muscles, while still achieving success
