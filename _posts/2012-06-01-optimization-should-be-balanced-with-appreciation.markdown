A person really close to me is an optimizer. She always sees opportunity to fix and improve things. Walking down the stairs she will see 15 different thing not in place and how may be the stair case design can be be improved for smother hold.

Well unfortunately this coin doesn't have a flip side, meaning she seldom says good things about any person, thing or process. She wouldn't appreciate the hard work that went into that food or that building or that garden. As if good things just are normal and nothing to be appreciated.

Moment of truth:are you or a close one of yours like that. Always unsatisfied, unhappy, unappreciative?
