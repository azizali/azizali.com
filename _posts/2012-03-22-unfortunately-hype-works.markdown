You will find literally 9,718,362 websites (I just made that number up) on the internet that   promise on how you can lose weight or make a billion dollars in 61 seconds. These websites either have one-off products, or hypefully sell their clients into continuity programs.

Its just sad that our emotions can be misused by unauthentic merchants. They prey on our vulnerabilities and weaknesses. The problem is that they understand our emotional triggers so well that they can sell us things in a breeze.

I wish more authentic merchants, innovators and artist would take some time out of their daily product development and go out to learn more about their customers. Understand their emotions, their needs and their hot buttons. So good people can help good consumers.
