A colleague of mine hates me, a lot. The reasons are difference in our working styles. I have tried to talk through our differences many times, have forgiven him for his bad behavior but no wins yet.

We gotta work together everyday and it so happens that he will not make eye contact with me. He does not wanna take my name and he will reply coldly if I try to start a conversation.

I feel sorry for him because he carries all that baggage with him.all the time. He doesn't let go. Think of you driving with your old cloths since childhood with you in your car all the time. You can't use those cloths. They stink, and they are a hassle to carry. Above all, it slows your journey down.

That's what most of us do. We carry old grudges and we do not forgive. It's exactly like baggage that
- are unhelpful/unuseful
- stink
- are a hassle to carry
- slows you down.

Who do you think looses? The person who forgives or the person who carries the load?

Who are you going to be.
