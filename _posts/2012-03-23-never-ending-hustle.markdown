I was reading Forbes.com today and found an article on a new and upcoming billionaire [Sara Blakely](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/03/07/undercover-billionaire-sara-blakely-joins-the-rich-list-thanks-to-spanx/). Sara started her company Spanx, a specialty undergarments company for women, while working in a full-time job. Her net worth is now $1 billion and she owns the company 100%.

This is what impressed me!



	
  * I know of NO self made billionaire who owns their company 100%. Sara managed to start and grow her company without any external funding and without and major partnerships that required her to give up equity.

	
  * She started her company completely while working full-time. Most of us complain all day on how their jobs suck and it takes too much time, hence we can't start our business.




A great read of all Entrepreneurs: [http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/03/07/undercover-billionaire-sara-blakely-joins-the-rich-list-thanks-to-spanx/](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2012/03/07/undercover-billionaire-sara-blakely-joins-the-rich-list-thanks-to-spanx/)
