I have seen countless times in companies that:



	
  1. The hiring team compromises on who they hire

	
  2. One "B" player makes a bunch of "A" players into "B" players

	
  3. "B" players are REactive,

	
  4. "A" players are PROactive

	
  5. Manager (Senior and Middle managers both) are often scared of their employees, since the employees do not respect their managers.
