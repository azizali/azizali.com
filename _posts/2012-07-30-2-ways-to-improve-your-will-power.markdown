I am reading a book titled "the willpower instinct" and it has mentioned two very, very simple ways to improve our willpower muscle.

1. Breath slowly. 4-6 breaths a minute.
2. Excercise: doesn't matter the amount or intensity of it.

The key is that both of the above tricks have to be done consistently, daily.

The slow berating or the excercise, both could be mere 5 minutes, daily.
