We often think that most of our goals are unachievable. We think that it is easy for others but not for us.

Is making 3 more sales call a day really that difficult. Or is it just that you are uncomfortable giving up television?

Is doing SEO that difficult? or are you just fooling yourself into believing that its too difficult.

Is buying that Mercedes/BMW/Audi/Lexus really that difficult, or are you uncomfortable committing to the _additional_ $100/month lease.

Most of the things that we think are beyond our reach are not as far as we think. They are just _slightly_ out of our comfort zone.

Making a habit of always reaching a little further out of your comfort zone is eventually going to expand your sphere of influence and sphere of comfort.
