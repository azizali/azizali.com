A persons actions should be better than his words. His words should not be better than his actions.

As a student of online marketing I came across many gurus who claimed to know it all. Sometimes they even came across as of they had figured out life. Their words were great but they were moderately successful, that is if they were successful.

Graduating from an tech startup incubator, I met dozens of really successful people and had them as my mentors. They openly told me what they didn't know and gave advice where they felt comfortable and confident.

The know it all guys took me to a journey of frustration and lack of results, the genuine mentors did the opposite.

Perfect example of why ones actions should be without exception better than their words. It's simply good for everyone.
