Only plant a seed when you know that the land you are on is stable and fertile enough to sustain the growth of the massive tree.

Often, we will pursue a dream, career, business or a relationship on a premise which may be weak or without any substance. If you do not like that person, if you do not have passion for the business idea, or if that career has a downward sloping demand, you are standing on the wrong land. Do not plant the seed of your effort in the wrong land - Because the tree will never grow healthy there.
