There is a old story about a wise man who lived a few thousand years ago before the invention of paper.

A guy comes up to the wise man and asks him a 100 questions, one after an other, without waiting for a response. The wise man listens to each of the question and gives the guy the answer to each question in order in which the questions were asked.

What???? Yes, its a real story and people back in the day had sharp memory, that they could memorize not only 100 questions, but the order of it as well.

Well, every day I get some idea, while jogging, driving, eating or bathing, and I think of posting it here, but quickly I forget. I wish I had the robust memory like my ancestors.

We all get BRILLIANT ideas often, GENIUS ideas that are so amazing that it shakes us, but then the cloud and blur of everyday life hides the idea, and it becomes almost impossible to recall the idea. Hence I have decided to put a postit sticky and a pen near my bed, in the car and other places. If I don't have them, I can simply write it on my smart phone.

I encourage everyone to do the same.
