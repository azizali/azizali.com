There are exceptions to all rules, since success pardons all sins.
What do I mean?

In the Founders Institute, we have strict criteria of selecting a business name. For example

1. You must have a.dot.com
2. The name should not be too literal that it is limiting
3. No misspelling names.

But you see.
1. About.me & de.li.co.us are not dot.com
2. YouTube is too liberal
3. Flickr & fiverr are missings.
