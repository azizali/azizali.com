I know people who would only build websites in .HTML, others prefer WordPress, Joomla. Drupal. Some wanna program in PHP others in Ruby.

Similarly in the startup world the lean movement has taken over and some people follow the lean startup book by the T. There are several idea validation matrix and people follow them too.

These are all frameworks, or paths to achieving a goal. Whether is be building a product or driving to work.

Being loyal to a particular framework is never a good decision. Instead be loyal to the principals that make a framework great. That approach will.make us think and hence will have a deeper understanding of what we are doing and why we are doing, the way we are.

In my view, holistic approaches are always the fastest, friction free and great for the longterm.
