Negotiations can be intimidating. Its difficult to estimate what to expect and what will be thrown at you as part of the negotiation process. In the mist of feverish activity, its easy to get unfocused and distracted.

Whenever I go into aÂ negotiation, I keep two things in mind:



	
  1. What is the goal I want to accomplish and what are the objectives that I will never give-up or compromise. (Its important to know both)

	
  2. When you are confused, never make a decision. Even when you are forced to make a decision on the spot. 99% of the time, decisions can wait.
