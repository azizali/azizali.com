Hitler did it by force, and people hated him. Most patents will punish, scold and scream at their children to discipline them. Do you think the child is thinking, "mom is right I should not do that thing"  or the child is thinking, "I am upset, mom.doesn't like me, I made her mad."

Rather than teaching the children, we scare them.

Rather than using skill, we scold. We as adults need more training and discipline than our innocent children.
