Tiger Wood's dad was not world class golfer, but he coached his son to become one.

Warren Buffett's dad was again not world class investor, but Warren learned from him.

All the best teams in sports do not have coaches who can actually play the sport at world class level, but they do have teaching and analysis capability to properly pin point the improvements and communicate them.

I actually always wanted mentors who were world class in the thing I wanted coaching on, but I was wrong. They don't have to be one.
