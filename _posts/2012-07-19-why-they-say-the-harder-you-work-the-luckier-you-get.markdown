A seminar attendee volunteered to make a few phone calls to signup random people to the seminar. She made 79 calls and did not get a single person to say yes.

But then, the 80th, 81st and 82nd call converted to a sale.

If she would have made only the first 10 calls, she had a 100% failure rate, she would have concluded that "calls don't work"

But making 82 calls made her get a success at 3/82 = 3.66% success rate.

Thats why they say, the harder you work the luckier you get.
