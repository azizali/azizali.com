There will be days that you will feel down, with lack of energy. You will feel unproductive for the day. Do not push, to make the day productive, its okay.

Go hang out with friends, watch a movie or tv, and just take a day off.

I know it sounds counter intuitive, but this will get your stress out and get you ready for the next day.
