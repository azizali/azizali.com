As I am working on several projects, I discovered several competitors who are already doing what I want to do. Discouraged I got overwhelmed, uncertain, and dishearted on the verge of giving up the project.

I go to pray, and recite Quran to calm myself down. Right after, a few thoughts went through my mind. My competitor is too complicated and feature driven to the extend that they are not giving anything of value to the consumer easily. The value is kinda hidden and a pain in the neck to get to. My product on the other hand is far more simple to use.

Then I thought: Did Google founders Larry and Sergy say that hey, Yahoo is already there and offering the solution and they are big, so we can't compete with them, lets give up even before we launch? NO

Did Facebook say that there is MySpace, Friendster and Orkut so Facebook is a stupid idea, lets give up, NO again.

So I decided to crush my competition and keep going with the product.
