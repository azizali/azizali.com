Individually, we all are a different person for different people.

We are a father(mother), brother(sister), grandson(granddaughter), husband(wife), lead member, friend, boss, employee etc. The list goes on.

In my daily diary, I write the same thing everyday, its an affirmation of what I am, or want to become. I aspire to be the rockstar son, brother, boss, employee, husband, again the list goes on. Rockstar to me means, best there could be.

Now when I write this in my diary everyday, if effects my day, when I encounter my dad, my mother, my brother and the other relationships in my life. I wan to do what a rockstar son, brother, husband would do.

And that is the simple guiding principle I follow.
