I often go running, my max has been 4.5 miles and I usually run 2-3 miles in a set. In my short experience I have noticed a pattern. As I start running, everything is smooth, and as I have ran 0.3 miles, I feel exhausted, and I have doubts in my mind whether I can ran any further. Usually at this point, I have to push myself.

This difficult stage is short lived and I easily get in the zone after the 0.4 miles. From that point to 2 mile benchmark is a breeze.

When I am half way done, making the u turn is very encouraging and discouraging at the same time because I am happy to make it half way, but I then think.. "oh my God, I am only half way done!"

That critical u-turn moment is intense but lives only a few seconds.

During the 2-2.5 mile passage there are several doubtful moments when I feel exhausted and wonder how I am going to make it to the 4th mile benchmark. But again, the 2.5- 3.5 range flys by fast.

The last 0.2 miles are agonizing, and my body and mind is ready to give up. But of course I can't stop towards the end, so by sheer will, I finish the running, fall on my back in the backyard and pour the entire bottle of water bottle on my head to cool myself and speed up the recovery.

Interestingly all major projects of life have a similar stress cycle. 80% don't start, and from the 20% who start, most people stop at the 0.3 mile range. After more people dropping throughout the journey, only 3-5% actually get to the finish line.
