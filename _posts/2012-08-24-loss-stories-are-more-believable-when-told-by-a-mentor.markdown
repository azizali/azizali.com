I met three of my mentors on Tuesday, and I realized that the most profound message/learning came through when the mentors told a story of how they lost, and why they lost. I wonder why that happens?

Firstly stories are much more believable, secondly if the stories consists of losses and initial disappointments, it aligns with a regular guy's experience, who is also going through frustration and is facing closed doors and small losses. This makes the message even more believable.

Then when the mentors tell how those losses were just part of the journey and now they are passed that, THAT my friend shouts out and says, we can make it as well, and we are on the right path
