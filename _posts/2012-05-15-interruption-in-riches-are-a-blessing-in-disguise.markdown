Most things in life are truely enjoyed when they are interrupted.

You take your spouse for granted, you do not show gratitude to the food you are blessed or the shelter of your home or the overal security in your life. Teenagers think that their parents are stupid, and almost all of us take our healthy body for granted as well.

But when all of these riches are interrupted, we tend to get on track and appreciate them.

Do not wait for the bad times to teach you a lesson, live with gratitude today.
