When you are broke, you say "I would do anything to get a job"
When you get a job, you say "They don't pay me enough"

When you make a quote out to a client and get accepted, you say "I wish I had quoted them more"

When you invest in a company and get a ridiculously high return, you say "I wish I had negotiated a better deal with them and invested more."

Looking back and "WISHING" is not only easy, but also a FOOLING mechanism built into us.

Bottom line:Â You made the BEST decision you could in that moment in time, and after the fact, you are simply more informed to make better decisions in the future.
