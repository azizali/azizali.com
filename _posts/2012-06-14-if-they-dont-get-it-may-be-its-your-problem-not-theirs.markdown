I am enrolled in Founders institute, which is an early stage incubator for tech startups. I am in a group on 21 aspiring entrepreneurs and its an awesome experience.

One pattern I am noticing is that entrepreneurs are so cloudes by their own problems and challenged with the business that they rarely take the feedback.

I see entreprenuers find it difficult to shut up. When a user or a mentor gives you feedback, say thank you. There is no point trying to forcefully convince them on any thing. Either they get or they don't.

You just gotta openly take in their feedback and keep honing your product and pitch until they get it in a snap.

If they don't get it in a snap its your problem, not theirs.
