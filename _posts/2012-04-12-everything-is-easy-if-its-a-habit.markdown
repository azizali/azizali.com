As human, its easy to process a bajilion things at a time, but in reality this practice robs us from focus and clarity.

It's a difficult task for us to sit in one place and think of nothing for 2 minutes, God forbid 10 mins.

To double or even quadruple your productivity just plan your day the night before. This will make your subconcious mind organise and prepare yourself for the next day.

It has to be done religiously, and you will be amazed how productive you will become.
