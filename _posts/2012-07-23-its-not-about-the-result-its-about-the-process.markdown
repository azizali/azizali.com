I just finished watching a boxing fight. It was Timothy Bradley Vs Manny Pacquiao. After every round, I was paying close attention to how the coaches spoke with the athlete. Pacquiao's coach was actually reflecting on the fight and advising on to how to approach the fight. He was advising on the process of fighting. (i.e. block better, do not follow the opponent, because he will have a better shot if you do that, etc.)

On the other hand Bradley's coach was all about the results. He was saying stuff like, "What are you F#$#-ing, doing, you have to win this, you were suppose to win in the second round, this is eight"

The former coaching puts pressure on an already pressured athlete, its not advice, and its not helpful.

Finally it was a close fight between two world class athletes. Bradley was announced the winner, but on later, the decision was found questionable. On further judging and reviewing of the tape, Pacquiao was the clear winner.
