_"Generosity Keeps the Engine Running" -Â Austin Kleon_

The world goes round because good things keep happening, there are artist, leaders, change agents who do good, give the gifts in the form of money, time, advice, and support just from the goodness of their heart. Just to give. Some people might say that those altruist people want fame in return, they might be right, but only in some cases. For the majority, they do it for the peace their heart receives.
