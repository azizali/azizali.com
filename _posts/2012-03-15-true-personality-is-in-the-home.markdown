We often take people we love for granted. We scold our children and use our authority to press on their wants. We claim that they do not understand, when in fact we don't. We are uncompromising with our family members. Every habit of theirs is a pet peeve of ours. They annoy us and we want to give them short and un-colloquialÂ answers.

All of a sudden we have a very nice, friendly and understanding behavior with the rest of the world. They are right, their advice is more precious, and we talk with them with respect.

Which is our true personality?
