Seth Godin does not tweet. It's because its not his thing. He could easily do it, hire someone to manage it but why do it just for the sake of doing it?
 
You may read a book on weight loss, a friend may tell you about a business opportunity, and your spouse asks you to improve on your short temper. And being the optimist, and go getter you are, you commit on dieting, workout, starting a business and improving your temper at home all at the same time.

What do you think the chances of your success are in any one of them? I'd say slim to none. Such commitments, although made with the best intentions, are designed to set you up for failure.

Its better to say no to a few opportunities and pick one to attack first
