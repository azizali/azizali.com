Its better to work alone than to work for, with or along side toxic people.

Toxic people are B, C or lesser player. They live in fear. Fear that the other person will do a better job and will make them look bad. Fear that others may raise the bar and then they have to work harder/smarter as well. Fear that they will get fired.

So these toxic people develop smooth talking capability. They will attract similar toxic people and together they will attract the A players into becoming B and then C players. When they see that they are failing, they will attack the A players forcing them to retaliate (Which is a B player attitude.) By attraction or by attack, toxic people will find their way into making the environment toxic as well.

The fact is, its easy to destroy than it is to build hence:

Its better to work alone than to work for, with or along side toxic people.
