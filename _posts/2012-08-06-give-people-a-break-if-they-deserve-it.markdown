If that customer service rep is not friendly, if that vendor sales rep is unfair or angry, may be us, the customer, should give that rep a break. May be they need a hug, a smile, a break today. 

No one can force a smile to their face 100% of the time. May be today is when they need to be themselves rather than be controlled by the rules.
