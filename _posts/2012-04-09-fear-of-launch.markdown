We are so fearful that we don't launch. As entrepreneurs we build that product that we think is best. The web app, the mobile app, the device, the invention, the service, the solution - we work on every aspect of it but we fail to launch and subcontiously delay the launch. We seek perfection not because we know we can achieve it but because we are scared how the market is going to react to it.

We know what's going to happen when we write that piece of code, there is certainty in that but we don't know whether the customer is going to like our creation, hence most of us don't ship and avoid the feedback loop which is critical to any success.
