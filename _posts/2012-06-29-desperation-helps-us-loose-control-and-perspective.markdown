Sometimes we want that phone call from our partner;
That contract signed by our client;
That email reply by our advisors, so desperately, that when we don't get it in the moment we want it, our world doesn't function right.

We start questioning our existence, our life. We ask questions like
Why did I start this company/relationship etc? or what am I doing with my life?

We all have these moments, but they are just a hard workout to exercise our patience muscles. It's maybe a blessing in disguise, to help us prepare for something better. They force us to not get the good opportunity, so we automatically become l available to the great ones.

It's just a harsh moment, and it will be over soon.
