Marketing and business strategy is not something that you outsource. Many competent people create great solutions, services and products. And after they are done, they start a quest to find a marketer, a distributor or a platform they can leverage to make it big.

Listen! all musicians make music and then try to sign a record deal with big company who can make them big. Authors do the same for their book. But the musician/author or other artist who get more popular are not because of the distribution, but because of their resonance with the audience.

Marketing and strategy are married to the product. The core MUST be to put the customer/client/user first, and then the marketing and the strategy will follow.

Since you are the product creator, its your obligation to understand the market and your audience, and since you will understand the audience the best, you must be the marketer as well.

Of course you should seek consultation and teach yourself some tricks and tips using some books but you are the person ultimately in charge.

Do not run away from it, embrace it. Marketing and strategy becomes fun and easy if your product resonates with your audience.
