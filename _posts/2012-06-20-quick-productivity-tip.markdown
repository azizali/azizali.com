I learnt a week ago that Google offices are highly illuminated with florescent lights for a scientific reason. More light prevents you from falling a sleep. A certain chemical(forgive me I do not know the name of the chemical) does not release from our body at a certain illumination which makes us more active.

The day I found that, I moved my lamp in my office closer to my desk and added brighter bulbs :)
