We some how believe, that we will be better people in the future. That is why we delay that workout, and eat that chocolate today saying we will not eat tomorrow. That is why we delay the todays work, thinking our future self will be organized and motivated tomorrow.

Well, you will be the same tomorrow! How about you improve a little today, tomorrow you will improve a little too on top of todays improvement- that is exponential improvement.
