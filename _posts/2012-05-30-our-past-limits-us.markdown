Did you know that our bodies recreate itself every few years. That means any given cell in your body did not exist a few years ago. Why is it that we have a natural system of renewal while our mind remains married to our past.

When we are thinking of a project, we take reference from out past thinking we are not good at that hence we should avoid a certain task.

When we advice others we refer to our past successes and failures.

Of course that is helpful but also limiting us more often than not.

I am an introvert, I am impatient, I am a quick decision maker. But that doesn't mean I can't be patient and slow at deciding. It's just a mindset.
