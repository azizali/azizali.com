If you are in a pitch dark room, you have no vision; so you rely more heavily on your other senses to navigate around.

When Tim Ferriss had limited time to finish his research paper, he said that, that limitation made him focused and he was able to produce a higher quality paper due to that focus.

When tech startups have 6 months of money left in th bank, they panic, but others get focused and produce faster.

Most of the Fortune 500 companies came about because they started from where they had limited.resources.

Embrace limitations and be creative.
