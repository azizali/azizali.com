Many times small loses such as loss of employee, loss of a deal, a partner etc feels like a bigger loss because we are emotionally invested. We have spend a ton of time and energy in that hence if it doesn't work out we feel defeated.

Now in these circumstances, its good to realize that we learn important lessons in these losses since many more are going to come our way. In the big picture, I think, small losses are small prices we pay for education and learning.
