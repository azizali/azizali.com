Why did they all use the term Steal, Stealing means someone lost and the thief won. It means the good lost and the bad won

**Inspiration is a better word.** Because Inspiration means that my source of inspiration is continuing to do its part and my creation does its part in its own unique way. Nobody lost, and everyone won.


## **All the big dogs who meant it well, but they used the wrong word.**

And then one day someone will steal from you. **- Francis Ford Coppola_
