As humans its our lizard brain who wants us to do nothing in the times of doubt and uncertainty.

Just this morning, my neighbor's cat was roaming around our backyard hunting for birds that we feed. I saw the cat walking by through my window so I slammed the window to make a sharp noise to scare the cat away from the birds.

But this is what happened. As the cat heard the slamming sound she instantly stopped, she was unsure what was happening so she looked around for a few seconds to verify her surrounding. When she was certain, she continued walking.

We humans are no different. When the economy is unstable, when times are bad, and when times are uncertain, we stop moving. We stop innovating, we stop thinking outside the box. We stop until the situation gets better, but we hardly ever proactively do anything to make the situation better.

The true leaders among us are the ones who take the stand and ignite the light in times of darkness. When nobody can look through the mist, they cut through the blur to see the road.

This behavior is not intuitive to man. Its a habit that we must cultivate over time.
