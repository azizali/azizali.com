A few doctors, engineers, teachers and other professionals were asked "What percentage of their work is mental?" most of them responded that 90% of their work required mental ability.

Then they were asked a followup question "What percentage of their training constitutes for mental training?" they responded that less than 10% of their training is mental training.

Our self image, our confidence, our patience and our ability to tackle with challenges are all as strong as our mental ability, but its sad that its hard for us to calm our minds for even 5 minutes.

Its difficult to take out time for gratitude, meditation, prayer and visualization. Its difficult but its a must if we want hone our mental ability.
