If I were a whinner, today I would say that my head and my eyes hurts a lot hence its ok to not fulfill that commitment. Doesn't matter how small the commitment is: A phone call to your mom, a logg in a blog, a good night kiss to your kid.

The commitment to your promise defines your integrity and destiny.

You either have more commitment or more excuses!
